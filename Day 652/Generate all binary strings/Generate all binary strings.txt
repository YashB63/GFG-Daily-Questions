Given an integer n. 

You need to generate all the binary strings 
of n characters representing bits.

Note: Return the strings in  ascending order.


Examples:

Input: n = 2

Output: [00, 01, 10, 11]

Explanation: As each position can be either 0 or 1, 
the total possible combinations are 4.


Input: n = 3

Output: [000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111]

Explanation: As each position can be either 0 or 1, 
the total possible combinations are 8.


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 20
