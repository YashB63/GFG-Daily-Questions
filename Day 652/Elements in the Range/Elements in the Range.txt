Given an array arr[] containing positive elements. 

A and B are two numbers defining a range. 

The task is to check if the array contains 
all elements in the given range (inclusive).

Note: If the array contains all elements in the given 
range return true otherwise return false.


Examples :

Input: n = 7, A = 2, B = 5, arr[] =  {1, 4, 5, 2, 7, 8, 3}

Output: True

Explanation: It has all elements between range 2-5 i.e 2,3,4,5.


Input: n = 7, A = 2, B = 6, arr[] = {1, 4, 5, 2, 7, 8, 3}

Output: False

Explanation: The array does not contain 6 
hence it do not contains all elements in 
the range 2-6, the output is No.


Your Task:

This is a function problem. 

You don't need to take any input, 
as it is already accomplished by 
the driver code. 

You just need to complete the function 
check_elements() that takes array arr, 
integer N, integer A, and integer B  
as parameters and returns the boolean 
True if array elements contain all 
elements in the given range else 
boolean False.

 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7
