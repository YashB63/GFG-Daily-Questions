Given a Binary Tree, check whether the given 
Binary Tree is Complete Binary Tree or not. 

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in 
which every level, except possibly the last, 
is completely filled, and all nodes should be 
as much close to left as possible.


Examples:

Input: root = [1, 2, 3]

Output: true

Explanation: The given tree is complete binary tree.


Input: root = [1, 2, 3, 4, N, 5, 6]

Output: false

Explanation: The given tree is not complete 
binary tree because in last level all nodes 
are not at left.


Constraints:

1<=number of node<=10^5
0 <= node -> data <= 10^6
