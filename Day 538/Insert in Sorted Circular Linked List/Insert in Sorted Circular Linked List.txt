Given a sorted circular linked list, 
the task is to insert a new node in 
this circular linked list so that it 
remains a sorted circular linked list.


Examples:

Input: head = 1->2->4, data = 2

Output: 1->2->2->4

Explanation: We can add 2 after the second node.


Input: head = 1->4->7->9, data = 5

Output: 1->4->5->7->9

Explanation: We can add 5 
after the second node.


Constraints:

2 <= number of nodes <= 10^6
0 <= node->data <= 10^6
0 <= data <= 10^6
