The task is to write two functions for 
a queue, enqueue(k) and findFrequency(k). 

The first function inserts a given item k 
and the second function finds frequency of 
a given item k.

Every test case has two arrays. 

The first arrays is, insert[] which contains 
elements to be inserted in the queue. 

The second array is findFreq[] which contains 
items whose frequencies need to be found out.

Note:
enqueue(k) will be called for 
every element k in insert[].

findFrequency(k) will be called 
for every element k in findFreq[];


Examples:

Input: insert[] = 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 1, 
findFreq[] = 1 3 2 9 10

Output: 2 2 2 -1 -1

Explanation:
After inserting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3 
and 1 into the queue, frequency of 1 
is 2, 3 is 2 and 2 is 2.

Since 9 and 10 are not there in 
the queue we output -1 for them.


Input: insert[] = 1 2 1 1 1 4, 
findFreq[] = 1 5 4 3

Output: 4 -1 1 -1

Explanation:
After inserting 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 
and 4 into the queue, frequency 
of 1 is 4 and that of 4 is 1. 

Since 5 and 3 are not there in 
the queue we output -1 for them.


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^3
1 <= m <= 10^3
1 <= Elements of Queue <= 10^6
