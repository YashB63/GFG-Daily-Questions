Given two integers M, N, and a 2D matrix 
Mat of dimensions MxN, clockwise rotate 
the elements in it.


Example 1:

Input:
M=3,N=3
Mat=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

Output:
4 1 2
7 5 3
8 9 6

Explanation:
Rotating the matrix clockwise gives this result.


Example 2:

Input:
M=2,N=3
Mat=[[1,2,3],[2,3,3]]

Output:
2 1 2
3 3 3

Explanation:
Rotating the matrix clockwise gives this result.


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function rotateMatrix() 
which takes two integers M, N, and a 2D matrix as 
input parameters and returns the clockwise rotated 
matrix.


Expected Time Complexity:O(M*N)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)


Constraints:
1<=M,N,Mat[i][j]<=1000
