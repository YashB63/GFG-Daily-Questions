Given a positive integer N, find the smallest 
number S such that the product of all the 
digits of S is equal to the number N. 

If there's no such number, Print "-1".


Example 1:

Input:
N = 100

Output:
455

Explanation:
4*5*5 = 100. There are no numbers
less than 455 with the product of
it's digit as 100.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 26
Output:
-1
Explanation:
There are no numbers which can form
a product of 26 with its digits.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function getSmallest() 
which takes an Integer N as input and returns the 
answer as a String.

 
Expected Time Complexity: O(log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^9
