An encoded string S consisting of alphabets(lowercase) 
and integers(1<=num<=9) is given, 
the task is to decode it and print the character 
at the 'K'th position in the string. 

The pattern in which the strings were encoded were as follows :\

original string: jonjonsnowjonjonsnowjonjonsnow
encoded string: jon2snow3

Note: encoded string will always start 
with an alphabet and end with a number.


Example 1:

Input:
str = "jon2snow3"
k = 8

Output:
n

Explanation:
The given string after decoding it will be 
as such: jonjonsnowjonjonsnowjonjonsnow. 
8th character in the string after decoding is:'n'.


Example 2:

Input:
str = "q3"
k = 3

Output:
q

Explanation:
The given string after decoding it will be
as such: qqq. 3rd character in the string 
after decoding is:'q'.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function decodeIt() 
which takes the string str and an integer k as 
input parameters and returns the kth character 
of the mentioned string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N), Where N is the size of the original string.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
2 <= |str| <= 35
1 <= k <= N
