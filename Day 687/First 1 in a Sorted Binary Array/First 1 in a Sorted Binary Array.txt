Given a sorted array arr consisting of 0s and 1s. 

The task is to find the index (0-based indexing) 
of the first 1 in the given array.

NOTE: If one is not present then, return -1.


Examples :

Input : arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output : 6

Explanation: The index of first 1 in the array is 6.


Input : arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 0]

Output : -1

Explanation: 1's are not present in the array.


Expected Time Complexity: O(log (n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1
