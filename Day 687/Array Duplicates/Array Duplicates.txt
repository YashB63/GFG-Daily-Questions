Given an array arr[] of size n, containing 
elements from the range 1 to n, and each 
element appears at most twice, return an 
array of all the integers that appears 
twice.

Note: You can return the elements in any 
order but the driver code will print 
them in sorted order.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

Output: [2, 3] 

Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more 
than once in the given array.


Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2] 

Output: []

Explanation: There is no repeating element 
in the array, so the output is empty.


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
