You are given an integer n. 

Your task is to determine whether 
it is a palindrome.

A number is considered a palindrome if it 
reads the same backward as forward, like 
the string examples "MADAM" or "MOM".


Examples:

Input: n = 555

Output: true

Explanation: The number 555 reads the same 
backward as forward, so it is a palindrome.


Input: n = 123

Output: false

Explanation: The number 123 reads differently 
backward (321), so it is not a palindrome.


Input: n = 1221

Output: true


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^9
