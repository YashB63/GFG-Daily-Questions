Given two integers a and b, You have to compute 
their LCM and GCD and return an array containing 
their LCM and GCD.


Examples:

Input: a = 5 , b = 10

Output: [10, 5]

Explanation: LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while their GCD is 5.


Input: a = 14 , b = 8

Output: [56, 2]

Explanation: LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while their GCD is 2.


Input: a = 1 , b = 1

Output: [1, 1]

Explanation: LCM of 1 and 1 is 1, while their GCD is 1.


Constraints:
1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^4
