You are playing a game. 

At each level of the game, you have to 
choose one of the roads to go to the 
next level. 

Initially, you have h amount of 
health and m amount of money.

If you take the first road then health decreases 
by 20 and money increase by 5. If you take the 
second road then your health decreases by 5 and 
money decrease by 10. 

If you take the third road then your health 
increases by 3 and money increase by 2.

You have to tell what is the maximum level 
you can reach up to under the constraints 
that in no two consecutive levels you can 
select the same road twice and once your 
health or money becomes <= 0 game ends
(that level is not counted).


Example 1:

Input:
H=2
M=10

Output:
1

Explanation:
For the first level, we can only choose the third road.

Now we cannot move ahead anymore.


Example 2:

Input:
H=20
M=8

Output:
5

Explanation:
Go like this:- R3(23,10)->R1(3,15)->R3(6,17)->
R2(1,7)->R3(4,9)-> game ends as we cannot choose
any more roads.
 

Your Task:
 
You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function maxLevel() 
which takes in the health and the money as input 
and returns the maximum level that can be reached 
by you.

 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N*N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*N)


Constraints:
1 <= H,M<=800.
