Working with 2D arrays is quite important. 

Here we will do swapping of columns in a 2D array. 

You are given a matrix arr[][] of r rows and c columns. 

You need to swap the first column with the last column.


Example:

Input:
r = 3
c = 4
arr[][] = {{1, 2, 3, 4},
           {4, 3, 2, 1},
           {6, 7, 8, 9}}

Output:
4 2 3 1
1 3 2 4
9 7 8 6
 

Your Task:

Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. 

Just complete the provided function interchange() that take rows 
and columns number as parameter. 

In a new line, print the modified matrix.


Constraints:

1 <= r, c <= 100
