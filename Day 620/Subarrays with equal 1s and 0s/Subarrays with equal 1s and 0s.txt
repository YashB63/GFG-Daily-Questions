Given an array arr[] containing 0s and 1s. 

Count the number of subarrays having equal 
number of 0s and 1s.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Output: 8

Explanation: The index range for the 8 sub-arrays are: 
(0, 1), (2, 3), (0, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5) ,(2, 5), (0, 5), 
(1, 6)


Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Output: 1

Explanation: The index range for the subarray is (3,4).


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1
