Given two integers l and r find the absolute difference 
between the number of composites and the number of primes 
between the range l and r (both inclusive).


Example 1:

Input: l = 4, r = 6

Output: 1

Explanation: Composite no. are 4 and 6.
And prime is 5.


Example 2:

Input: l = 4, r = 4

Output: 1

Explanation: There is no prime no. in [l,r]
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function Count() 
which takes L and R as input parameters and 
returns the difference between no. of composites 
and primes between [l, r].
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(nlog(n)) where n = r - l + 1
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)
 

Constraints:

1 <= l <= r <= 10^6
