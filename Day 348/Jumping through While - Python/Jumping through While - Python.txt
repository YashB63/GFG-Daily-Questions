Now you are familiar with While loop in Python. 

Let's get deeper into understanding 
it through below question.

Given a positive integer x, the task 
is to print the numbers from 1 to x in 
the order as 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, ... 
(in increasing order).


Example:

Input:
x = 10

Output:
1 4 9

Explanation:
From 1 to 10, numbers in powers
of 2 are, 12, 22, 32 as 1, 4 and 9.


Your Task:

This is a function problem. 

You need to complete the function printIncreasingPower().


Constraints:
2 <= x <= 10^3
