Given a number n. 

Your task is to check whether it is fascinating or not.

Fascinating Number: A number with 3 or more digits 
is considered fascinating if, when it is multiplied 
by 2 and 3, and the resulting products are concatenated 
with the original number, the final sequence contains 
all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

Note:  If a number is fascinating, return true. 

Otherwise, return false.


Examples:

Input: n = 192

Output: true

Explanation: After multiplication with 2 and 3, 
and concatenating with original number, number 
will become 192384576 which contains all digits 
from 1 to 9.


Input: n = 853

Output: false

Explanation: It is not a fascinating number


Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
100 <= n <= 2*10^9
