Given an positive integer n, find a subset of 
numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), where each 
number can be used at most once, such that:

The XOR of all elements in the subset is exactly n.

The size of the subset is as large as possible.

If multiple such subsets exist, choose the 
lexicographically smallest one.

Lexicographical Order : A subset A[] is 
lexicographically smaller than subset B[] 
if at the first index where they differ, 
A[i] < B[i] (based on character ASCII/Unicode values).

If all elements match but one subset ends 
earlier, the shorter subset is considered 
smaller.


Examples:

Input: n = 4

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Explanation: We choose all 
the elements from 1 to 4. 

Its xor value is equal to n. 

This is the maximum possible 
size of the subset.


Input: n = 3

Output: [1, 2]

Explanation: 1 ^ 2 = 3, This is the smallest 
lexicographical answer possible with maximum 
size of subset i.e 2.


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
