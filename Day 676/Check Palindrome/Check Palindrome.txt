Given a string s, you need to check if 
it is palindrome or not. 

A palidrome is a string that reads the 
same from front and back.

Note: Ignore the case in this question.


Examples:

Input: s = "Hello"

Output: false

Explanation: Hello is not equal to olleH so it's not a palindrome.


Input: s = "TenEt"

Output: true

Explanation: TenEt == tEneT as we are ignoring the case.
