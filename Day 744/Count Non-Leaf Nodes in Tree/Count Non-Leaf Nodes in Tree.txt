Given a Binary Tree of size n, your task is to 
return the count of all the non-leaf nodes of 
the given binary tree.


Example:

Input: 
Image

Output: 2

Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are 
the only non leaf nodes.


Input: 
          8
        /   \
       3     9
      / \
     1   6
        / \
       4   7

Output: 3

Explanation: Nodes 8, 3 and 6 are 
the only non leaf nodes.


Input: 
          10
        /    \
      5       20
     / \     /  \
    3   7   15   25

Output: 3

Explanation: Nodes 10, 5 and 20 
are the only non leaf nodes.


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^5
