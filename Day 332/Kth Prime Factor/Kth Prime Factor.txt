Given two numbers n and k, 
find the kth prime factor of n. 


Example 1:

Input: n = 225, k = 2

Output: 3

Explaination: The prime factors 3, 3, 5 
and 5. So 3 is the 2nd one.


Example 2:

Input: n = 81, k = 5

Output: -1

Explaination: The 4 prime factors are 
3, 3, 3, 3. So there is no 5th one.


Your Task:

You do not need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function kthPrime() 
which takes the value n and k as input parameters 
and return the kth prime number. 

If k is greater than total number of primes then return -1.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n*log(log n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ k ≤ 50
