Given a Matrix mat of n*n size. 

Your task is constructing a 2D linked list 
representation of the given matrix.

Input: mat = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

Output: 


Input: mat = [[23, 28], [23, 28]]

Output:


Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n^2)


Constraints:
1 <= mat.size() <=15
1 <= mat[i][j] <=10^4
