You are given an integer n. 

You need to convert all zeroes of n to 5.


Examples:

Input: n = 1004

Output: 1554

Explanation: There are two zeroes in 1004 on replacing 
all zeroes with 5, the new number will be 1554.


Input: n = 121

Output: 121

Explanation: Since there are no zeroes 
in 121, the number remains as 121.
