Given three integers, a, r and n. 

Where a is the first term, r is the common 
ratio of a G.P. and r is equal to 2.  

Calculate the nth term of GP.

The nth term is given by an = a * r^(n-1), where r = 2.


Examples:

Input: a = 2, n = 10

Output: 1024

Explanation: an = a * r^n-1 = 2 * 2^10-1 = 1024
