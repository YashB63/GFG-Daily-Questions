Given an array of integers arr[]. 

You have to find the Inversion Count of the array. 

Note : Inversion count is the number of pairs of 
elements (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j].


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]

Output: 3

Explanation: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 
has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Output: 0

Explanation: As the sequence is already 
sorted so there is no inversion count.


Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]

Output: 0

Explanation: As all the elements of array are same, 
so there is no inversion count.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4
