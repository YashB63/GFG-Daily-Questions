Given a Queue of even size. 

Your task is to rearrange the queue by 
interleaving its first half with the 
second half.

Interleaving is the process of mixing two 
sequences by alternating their elements 
while preserving their relative order.

In other words, Interleaving means place 
the first element from the first half and 
then first element from the 2nd half and 
again 2nd element from the first half and 
then second element from the 2nd half and 
so on....


Examples:

Input: q = [2, 4, 3, 1]

Output: [2, 3, 4, 1]

Explanation: we place the first element 
of the first half 2 and after that place 
the first element of second half 3 and 
after that repeat the same process one 
more time so the resulting queue will 
be [2, 3, 4, 1]


Input: q = [3, 5]

Output: [3, 5]

Explanation: We place the first element 
of the first half 3 and first element of 
the second half 5 so the resulting queue 
is [3, 5]
