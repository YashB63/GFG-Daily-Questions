Given a number N, your task is to complete the function 
which generates all n-bit grey code sequences, 
a grey code sequence is a sequence such that 
successive patterns in it differ by one bit.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 2

Output: 00 01 11 10

Explanation: All 2-bit gray codes are
00, 01, 11, 10 such that successive
patterns in it differ by one bit.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 1

Output: 0 1
 

Your Task:
Complete the function generateCode() which takes 
an integer as input parameter and retruns an array 
of all N bit grey code sequence such that successive 
patterns in it differ by one bit.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N * 2^N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 16
