You are given the head of two singly linked lists head1 
and head2 representing two non-negative integers. 

You have to return the head of the linked list 
representing the sum of these two numbers.

Note: There can be leading zeros in the input lists, 
but there should not be any leading zeros in the 
output list.


Examples:

Input: 
    
Output:  1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2

Explanation: Given numbers are 123 and 999. 

There sum is 1122.
    

Input: 
    
Output: 7 -> 0 

Explanation: Given numbers are 63 and 7. There sum is 70.
    

Constraints:

1 ≤ Number of nodes in head1, head2 ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ node->data ≤ 9
