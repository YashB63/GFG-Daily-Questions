Given an array arr of positive integers, return 
the minimum possible product of any k elements 
from the array. 

Return the result modulo 1e9 + 7.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: We will get the minimum product after 
multiplying 1 and 2 that is 2. So, the answer is 2.


Input: arr[] = [9, 10, 8], k = 3

Output: 720

Explanation: We have to multiply all the numbers.


Constraints:

1 ≤ k, arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
