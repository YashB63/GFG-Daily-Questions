Given a non-empty array arr[] of integers, find the top k 
elements which have the highest frequency in the array. 

If two numbers have the same frequencies, 
then the larger number should be given 
more preference.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1], k = 2

Output: [4, 1]

Explanation: Frequency of 4 = 2, Frequency of 1 = 2. 

These two have the maximum frequency and 4 is larger than 1.


Input: arr[] = [7, 10,11, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 11, 8, 9], k = 4

Output: [5, 11, 7, 10]

Explanation: Frequency of 5 = 3, Frequency of 11 = 2, 
Frequency of 7 = 2, Frequency of 10 = 1. 

These four have the maximum frequency 
and 5 is largest among rest.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5
1<= arr[i] <=10^5
1 <= k <= no. of distinct elements
