Given an unsorted array, arr. 

Finds the minimum number of removals 
required such that twice the minimum 
element in the array is greater than 
or equal to the maximum in the array.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 5, 100, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 200]

Output: 4

Explanation: In the given array 4 elements 4, 5, 
200 and 100 are removed from the array to make 
the array such that 2*minimum >= max (2*9 > 15).


Input: arr[] = [4, 7, 5, 6]

Output: 0

Explanation: We don't need to remove any element 
as  4*2 > 7 (Note that min = 4, max = 7).


Expected Time Complexity: O(n*logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
