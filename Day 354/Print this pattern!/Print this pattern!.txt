Given an integer N, you need to 
print the following pattern.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 3

Output:
33333
32223
32123
32223
33333

Explanation:
When N = 3 then there will be three boundaries.
Outer boundary contains only 3.
Middle boundary contains only 2.
And the inner boundary contains only 1.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 4

Output:
4444444
4333334
4322234
4321234
4322234
4333334
4444444


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input. 

Your task is to complete the function printPattern() 
which takes an integer N as an input parameter and 
print the pattern for it.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N^2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= N <= 9
