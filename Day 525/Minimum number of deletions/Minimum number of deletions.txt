Given a string s. 

The task is to remove or delete 
the minimum number of characters 
from the string s, so that the 
resultant string forms a palindrome. 

Find the minimum number of 
characters we need to remove.

Note: The order of characters 
should be maintained.


Examples:

Input: s = "aebcbda"

Output: 2

Explanation: Remove characters 'e' and 'd'. 

Resultant string will be "abcba" 
which is a palindromic string.


Input: s = "aba"

Output: 0

Explanation: We don’t remove any character.


Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10^3
