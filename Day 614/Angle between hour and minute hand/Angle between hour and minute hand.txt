Given a string s representing time in 24-hour 
format "HH:MM", compute the smallest angle in 
degrees between the hour and minute hands of 
an analog clock.

 
Examples:

Input: s = "06:00"

Output: 180.000

Explanation: When the time is 06:00, 
the angle between the hour and minute 
hands of the clock is 180.000 degrees.


Input: s = "03:15"

Output: 7.500

Explanation: When the time is 03:15, 
the angle between the hour and minute 
hands of the clock is 7.500 degrees.


Constraints:

s.size() = 5
00 ≤  HH  ≤ 23
00 ≤  MM  ≤ 59
