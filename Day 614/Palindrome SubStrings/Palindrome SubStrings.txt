Given a string s, count all palindromic 
sub-strings present in the string. 

The length of the palindromic sub-string 
must be greater than or equal to 2.

Note: A substring is palindromic if it 
reads the same forwards and backwards.


Examples:

Input: s = "abaab"

Output: 3

Explanation: All palindromic substrings 
(of length > 1) are: "aba", "aa", "baab".


Input: s = "aaa"

Output: 3

Explanation: All palindromic substrings 
(of length > 1) are: "aa", "aa", "aaa".


Input: s = "abbaeae"

Output: 4

Explanation: All palindromic substrings 
(of length > 1) are: "bb", "abba", "aea", 
"eae".


Constraints:

2 ≤ s.size() ≤ 5 * 10^3
s contains only lowercase english characters
