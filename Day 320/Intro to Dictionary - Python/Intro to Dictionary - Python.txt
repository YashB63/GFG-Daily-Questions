Congratulations..! you have passed 5 modules in Python. 

This module talks about dictionaries in Python. 

In Python, the efficient way to hash key/value 
pair is called a dictionary.


Initialization:

dict = {}
Setting values:

dict['a'] = 1 
dict['b'] = 2

Fetching values:

dict['a'] gives 1 as output 
dict['b'] gives 2 as output

Moving on to the question to implement a dictionary. 

Given a list of strings containing names of students and 
another list containing marks of corresponding students. 

The task is to create a dictionary to store marks of 
students with their names (name will be unique).


Example:

Input: 
N = 5 
names = [john, ala, ilia, sudan, mercy] 
marks = [100, 200, 150, 80, 300]

Output:
ala 200 
ilia 150 
john 100 
mercy 300 
sudan 80


Your Task:

The task is to complete the function create_dict() 
which takes arr as input and creates a dictionary 
then returns it.

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= marks <= 10^4
