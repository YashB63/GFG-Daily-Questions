You are given an array arr[] of positive integers. 

Your task is to find the smallest possible "Inverting Factor" 
among all pairs of integers in the array. 

The "Inverting Factor" of two integers is defined 
as the absolute difference between the reverse of 
the two integers.

Note: Trailing zeros in a number of ignored while reversing, 
i.e. 1200 becomes 21 when reversed.


Examples:

Input : arr[] = [56, 20, 47, 93, 45]

Output : 9

Explanation: The minimum inverting factor is 9 of the pair (56,47).

Reverse (56 -> 65) and (47 -> 74) so,difference between them is 9.

Input : arr[] = [48, 23, 100, 71, 56, 89]

Output :  14 


Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints : 
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
