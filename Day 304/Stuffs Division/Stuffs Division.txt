You are given an array arr[] where each element represents 
the amount of goodies currently held by students. 

Each student at index i should receive exactly i 
amount of goodies (1-based indexing) for a fair distribution, 
with no wastage allowed. 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible 
to redistribute the goodies such that the student 
at index i gets exactly i amount of goodies. 

Return true if it is possible otherwise return false.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [7, 4, 1, 1, 2]

Output: true

Explanation: Since, all the goods can be redistributed 
as 1 2 3 4 5 (ith students get i number of goodies).

So, output is true.


Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: false


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 10^6
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
