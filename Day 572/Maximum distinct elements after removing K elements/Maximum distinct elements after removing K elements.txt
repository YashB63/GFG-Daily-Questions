Given an array containing integers. 

The task is to find the maximum number 
of distinct elements after removing K 
elements from the array.


Examples:

Input : arr[] = [5, 7, 5, 5, 1, 2, 2], k = 3

Output : 4

Explanation: Remove 2 occurrences of element 
5 and 1 occurrence of element 2.


Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 5

Output : 2


Expected Time Complexity: O(n + m*logm +  k*logm)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(m).
(m is the number of distinct elements in the given array.)


Constraints:

1 ≤ k ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
