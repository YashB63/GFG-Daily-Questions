Given a string S, consisting of 
lowercase Latin characters [a-z]. 

Find out all the possible palindromes that 
can be generated using the letters of the 
string and print them in lexicographical 
order.


Example 1:

Input: S = abbab

Output:{ abbba babab }

Explanation: abbba and babab are two
possible string that are palindrome.


Example 2:

Input: S = abc

Output: {}

Explanation: No permutation is palindromic.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
all_palindromes() which takes string 
S as the input parameter and returns 
a list of strings that are palindrome 
in lexicographical order.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(2^n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(2^n)
 

Constraints:
1 <= Length of string <= 20
