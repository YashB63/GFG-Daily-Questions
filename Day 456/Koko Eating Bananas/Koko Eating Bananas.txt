Given an array arr[] of integers where 
each element represents a pile of bananas, 
and Koko has k hours to finish all the piles, 
find the minimum number of bananas (s) Koko 
must eat per hour to finish all the bananas 
within k hours. 

Each hour, Koko chooses a pile 
and eats s bananas from it. 

If the pile has fewer than s bananas, 
she consumes the entire pile for that 
hour and won't eat any other banana 
during that hour.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 6, 7, 11] , k = 8

Output: 4

Explanation: Koko eats at least 4 bananas 
per hour to finish all piles within 8 hours, 
as she can consume each pile in 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8 
hours.


Input: arr[] = [30, 11, 23, 4, 20], k = 5

Output: 30

Explanation: With 30 bananas per hour, 
Koko completes each pile in 1 hour, 
totaling 5 hours, which matches k = 5.


Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 15, 20], k = 7

Output: 10

Explanation: At 10 bananas per hour, 
Koko finishes in 7 hours, just within 
the k = 7 limit.


Constraint:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5 
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
arr.size() <= k <= 2*10^5
