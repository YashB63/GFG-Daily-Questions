A Tic-Tac-Toe board of size 3X3 is 
given after all the moves are played, 
i.e., all nine spots are filled. 

Find out if the given board is valid, i.e., 
is it possible to reach this board position 
after a set of moves or not.

Note that every arbitrarily filled grid of 
9 spaces isn’t valid, e.g., a grid filled 
with 3 X and 6 O isn’t a valid situation 
because each player needs to take alternate 
turns.

Note:  The game starts with X


Examples:

Input:
board[] = {'X', 'X', 'O', 
           'O', 'O', 'X',
           'X', 'O', 'X'};

Output: Valid

Explanation: This is a valid board.


Input:
board[] = {'O', 'X', 'X', 
           'O', 'X', 'X',
           'O', 'O', 'X'};

Output: Invalid

Explanation: Both X and O cannot win.


Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

Every character on the board 
can either be 'X' or 'O'.
