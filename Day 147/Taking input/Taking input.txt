Before implementing any algorithm, 
we should be thorough with taking inputs.
 
Here, we will learn how to read inputs.
You are given two inputs: a(integer), and b(string). 
You need to take the input and print a and b separated by a space.

Note: You have to print a new line 
at the end after prinintg a and b.


Example 1:

Input:
a = 5
b = Hello

Output:
5 Hello


Example 2:

Input:
a = 7
b = Geeks

Output:
7 Geeks


Expected time complexity: O(1)
Expected auxiliary space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= a <= 10^6
