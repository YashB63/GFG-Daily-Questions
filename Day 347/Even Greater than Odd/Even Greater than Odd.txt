Given an array arr, rearrange the array 
according to the following relations :

arr[i] >= arr[i-1], if i is even.
arr[i] <= arr[i-1], if i is odd.
[Considering 1-base indexed array]

Return the rearranged array.

Note: The driver code will print "true" if your output 
array satisfies the conditions; otherwise, it will print 
"false".


Example:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 1]

Output: [1, 2, 1, 2]

Explanation: Both 2s are at even positions 
and 1s at odd positions, satisfying the 
given conditions.


Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2]

Output: [1, 3, 2]

Explanation: The array is already arranged 
according to the conditions.


Constraints:

1 â‰¤ arr.size() â‰¤ 10^5
1 â‰¤ arr[i] â‰¤ 10^4
