Sixy primes are prime numbers that 
differ from each other by six. 

For example, the numbers 5 and 11 are both sixy primes, 
because they differ by 6. Given a range of the form [L, R]. 

The task is to find all the sixy prime pairs 
in the range in increasing order.


Example 1:

Input: L = 11, R = 19

Output: [11, 17, 13, 19] 

Explanation: There are total two pair possible
with difference 6 and these are 11,17,13,19.  


Example 2:

Input: L = 6, R = 20

Output: [7, 13, 11, 17, 13, 19]

Explanation: There are total three pair possible
with difference 6 and these are 7,13,11,17,13,19. 


Your Task: 
 
You dont need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function sixyPrime() which takes L 
and R as input parameter and returns all the sixy 
prime exist and if there are no sixy prime exist 
returns -1.


Expected Time Complexity: O(nloglogn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:

1 <= L <= R <=10^3
