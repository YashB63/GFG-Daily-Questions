Given two integers A and B. 

Find the smallest number X (greater than A) 
which is divisible by B.
 

Example 1:

Input:
A = 5
B = 3

Output:
6

Explanation:
6 is the smallest number
greater than 5 which is 
divisible by 3


Example 2:

Input:
A = 25
B = 13

Output:
26

Explanation:
26 is the smallest number
greater than 25 which is
divisible by 13

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function find() 
which takes two integers A and B as input 
parameters and returns a smallest possible 
integer greater than A which is divisible by B.
