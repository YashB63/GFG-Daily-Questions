Given three integers p, r and t, denoting Principal, 
Rate of Interest and Time period respectively. 

Your task is to calculate Simple Interest.


Examples:

Input: p = 100, r = 20, t = 2

Output: 40.00

Explanation: The simple interest on 100 at 
a rate of 20% across 2 time periods is 40.


Input: p = 999, r = 9, t = 9

Output: 809.19

Explanation: The simple interest on 999 at a 
rate of 9% across 9 time periods is 809.19


Constraints:

1<=p<=10^5
1<=r, t<=100
