Given two strings s1 and s2 consisting of only 
lowercase English letters and of equal length, 
check if these two strings are isomorphic to 
each other.

If the characters in s1 can be changed to get s2, 
then two strings, s1 and s2 are isomorphic. 

A character must be completely swapped out for 
another character while maintaining the order 
of the characters. 

A character may map to itself, but no two 
characters may map to the same character.


Examples:

Input: s1 = "aab", s2 = "xxy"

Output: true

Explanation: Each character in s1 can be consistently 
mapped to a unique character in s2 (a → x, b → y).


Input: s1 = "aab", s2 = "xyz"

Output: false

Explanation: Same character 'a' in s1 maps 
to two different characters 'x' and 'y' in s2.


Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "xxz"

Output: false

Explanation: Two different characters 'a' and 
'b' in s1 maps with same character 'x' in s2. 


Constraints:
1 ≤ s1.size() = s2.size() ≤ 10^5
