Given two singly linked lists, write a program to get 
the point where two linked lists intersect each other. 

If the linked list does not merge at any point, it 
should return NULL.


Examples:

Input: LinkedList1: 3->6->9->common, LinkedList2: 10->common, 
common: 15->30->NULL

Output: 15

Explanation:


Input: LinkedList1: 4->1->common, LinkedList2: 5->6->1->common, 
common: 8->4->5->NULL

Output: 8

Explanation: 
Expected Time Complexity: O(n+m)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)


Constraints:

Length of Both LinkedList before the intersection(if any) is greater than 0.
1 ≤ no. of nodes in LinkedList1, LinkedList2 ≤ 10^5
-1000 ≤ node->data ≤ 1000

Challenge: Try to solve the problem without using any extra space.
