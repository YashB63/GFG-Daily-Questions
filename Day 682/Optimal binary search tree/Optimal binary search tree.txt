You are given a set of distinct keys in sorted order, 
which is represent by keys[]. 

Each key ki represents a data record that is 
accessed during a seach operation. 

For all the keys, you are also given a frequency 
array freq[], which denotes how many times key 
ki is searched for.

The cost of accessing a key in a binary search tree 
is calculated by multiplying its access frequency 
by the level at which it appears in the tree. 

Therefore different arrangements of keys in the BST 
gives different total search costs.

Your task is to calculate the minimum total search 
cost required to construct a binary search tree 
containing all the keys.

Note: Consider the root of the BST is at level 1.


Examples:

Input: keys[] = [10, 12], freq[] = [34, 50]

Output: 118

Explaination: There can be following two possible BSTs
                                
The cost of tree I is 34*1 + 50*2 = 134
The cost of tree II is 50*1 + 34*2 = 118


Input: keys[] = [10, 12, 20], freq[] = [34, 8, 50]

Output: 142

Explaination: There can be many possible BSTs
 
Among all possible BSTs, 
cost of the 5th BST is minimum.  
Cost of this BST is 1*50 + 2*34 + 3*8 = 142


Constraints:

1 ≤ keys.size() = freq.size() ≤ 100
1 ≤ keys[i], freq[i] ≤ 10^4
