Given an array arr[], print all 
its elements space-separated.

Note: You don't need to move to 
the next line after printing all 
elements of the array 
(space-separated)


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: 1 2 3 4 5


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 5, 5]

Output: 2 3 5 5


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size <= 10^6
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^8
