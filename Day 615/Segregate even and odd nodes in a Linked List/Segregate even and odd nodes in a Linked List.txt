Given a link list, modify the list such 
that all the even numbers appear before 
all the odd numbers in the modified list. 

The order of appearance of numbers within 
each segregation should be the same as 
that in the original list.

NOTE: Don't create a new linked list, 
instead rearrange the provided one.


Examples:

Input: Linked list: 17->15->8->9->2->4->6

Output: 8->2->4->6->17->15->9

Explaination: 8,2,4,6 are the even numbers 
so they appear first and 17,15,9 are odd 
numbers that appear later.


Input: Linked List: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7

Output: 1->3->5->7

Explaination: There is no even number. 

So no need for modification.


Constraints:

1 ≤ size of linked list ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Each element of the list ≤ 10^5
