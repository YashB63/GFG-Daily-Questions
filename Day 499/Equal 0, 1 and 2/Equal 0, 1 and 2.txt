Given a string str of length N which consists 
of only 0, 1 or 2s, count the number of 
substring which have equal number of 0s, 
1s and 2s.
 

Example 1:

Input: str = “0102010”

Output: 2

Explanation: Substring str[2, 4] = “102” and
substring str[4, 6] = “201” has equal number
of 0, 1 and 2 


Example 2:

Input: str = “11100022”

Output: 0

Explanation: There is no substring with
equal number of 0 , 1 and 2.


Your Task: 
 
You don't need to read input or print anything.

Your task is to complete the function 
getSubstringWithEqual012() which takes 
a single string str as input and returns 
the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
