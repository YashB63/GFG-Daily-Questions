Given a string, s find the rank of the string amongst 
all its permutations sorted lexicographically. 

The rank can be big, so print it modulo 1000003. 

Note: Return 0 if the characters are repeated in the string.


Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"

Output: 1

Explaination: It is lexicographically the smallest 
string of the permutation.


Example 2:

Input: s = "acb"

Output: 2

Explaination: This is lexicographically the 
second smallest string of the permutation.


Your Task:

You do not need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function rank() which 
takes string s as input parameter and returns the 
rank modulo 1000003 of the string.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|s|)


Constraints:
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 26
