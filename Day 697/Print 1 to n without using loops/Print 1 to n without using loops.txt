Given an positive integer n, print numbers from 
1 to n without using loops.

Implement the function printTillN() to print the 
numbers from 1 to n as space-separated integers.


Examples

Input: n = 5

Output: 1 2 3 4 5

Explanation: We have to print numbers from 1 to 5.


Input: n = 10

Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Explanation: We have to print numbers from 1 to 10.


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
