Given a doubly linked list of n nodes sorted by values, 
the task is to remove duplicate nodes present in the 
linked list.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
1<->1<->1<->2<->3<->4

Output:
1<->2<->3<->4

Explanation:
Only the first occurance of node with value 1 is 
retained, rest nodes with value = 1 are deleted.


Example 2:

Input:
n = 7
1<->2<->2<->3<->3<->4<->4

Output:
1<->2<->3<->4

Explanation:
Only the first occurance of nodes with values 2,3 and 4 are 
retained, rest repeating nodes are deleted.


Your Task:

You have to complete the method removeDuplicates() 
which takes 1 argument: the head of the linked list.  

Your function should return a pointer to a linked 
list with no duplicate element.


Constraint:
1 <= n <= 10^5


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
