Given an array arr[], find the maximum sum of 
a non-empty subarray. You are allowed to skip 
at most one element in the subarray.

Note: After skipping the element, the 
subarray must still be non-empty.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, -4, 5]

Output: 11

Explanation: We can get maximum sum subarray by skipping -4.


Input: arr[] = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]

Output: 9

Explanation: We can get maximum sum subarray by skipping 
-2 as [4,-1,1,5] sums to 9, which is the maximum 
achievable sum.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^6
-10^3 <= arr[i]<= 10^3
