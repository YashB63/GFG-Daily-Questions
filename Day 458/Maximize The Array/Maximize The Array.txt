Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2 of size n. 

Use the greatest elements from the given arrays 
to create a new array of size n such that it 
consists of only unique elements and the sum 
of all its elements is maximum.

The created elements should contain the elements 
of arr2 followed by elements of arr1 in order of 
their appearance.

Note: The input array will be given in such way, 
that every time it is possible to make a new arr 
by maintaing the following conditions.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
arr1 = {7, 4, 8, 0, 1}
arr2 = {9, 7, 2, 3, 6}

Output: 9 7 6 4 8

Explanation: 9, 7, 6 are from 2nd array
and 4, 8 from 1st array.


Example 2:

Input: n = 4
arr1 = {6, 7, 5, 3}
arr2 = {5, 6, 2, 9} 

Output: 5 6 9 7 

Explanation: 5, 6, 9 are from 2nd array
and 7 from 1st array.


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function maximizeArray() 
which takes the array arr1[], arr2[] and n as input 
parameters and returns the desired array of integers.


Expected Time Complexity: O(nlog(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <=arr1[i]<= 10^9
0 <= arr2[i] <= 10^9
