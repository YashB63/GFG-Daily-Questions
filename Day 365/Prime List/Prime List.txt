You are given the head of a linked list. 

You have to replace all the values of the 
nodes with the nearest prime number.

If more than one prime number exists at an equal distance, 
choose the smallest one. Return the head of the modified 
linked list.


Examples :

Input: Linked List: 2 → 6 → 10

Output: 2 → 5 → 11

Explanation: The nearest prime of 2 is 2 itself. 

The nearest primes of 6 are 5 and 7, 
since 5 is smaller so, 5 will be chosen. 

The nearest prime of 10 is 11.


Input: Linked List: 1 → 15 → 20

Output: 2 → 13 → 19

Explanation: The nearest prime of 1 is 2. 

The nearest primes of 15 are 13 and 17, 
since 13 is smaller so, 13 will be chosen. 

The nearest prime of 20 is 19.


Expected Time Complexity: O(number of nodes * sqrt(value of node)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

1 ≤ Number of Nodes ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ Value on Node ≤ 10^4
