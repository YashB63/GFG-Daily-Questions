You are given an array of character pairs and a string s. 

Your task is to count how many of the character 
pairs from the array appear in the string s.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [('A','G'),('d','i'),('P','o')], s = "APiod"

Output: 2

Explanation: 
In the string "APiod", the pairs (d, i) 
and (P, o) appear. 

Thus, the answer is 2.


Input: arr[] = [('r','e')], s = "ghe"

Output: 0

Explanation: In the string "ghe", there 
are no characters that match the pair (r, e). 

Thus, the answer is 0. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(n), n is the size of arr.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

1<=s.size()<=10^6
1<=arr.size()<=10^6

The string s and the characters in each pair 
are either lowercase or uppercase alphabets.
