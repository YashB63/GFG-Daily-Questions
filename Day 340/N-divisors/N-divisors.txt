Given three integers A, B, N. 

Your task is to print the number of 
numbers between A and B including them, 
which have N-divisors. 

A number is called N-divisor if it has 
total N divisors including 1 and itself.
 

Example 1:

Input:
A = 1
B = 7
N = 2

Output:
4

Explanation:
2,3,5,7 have 2-divisors


Example 2:

Input:
A = 1
B = 25
N = 3

Output:
3

Explanation:
4,9,25 are the numbers
having 3-divisors


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function count() 
which takes integer A, B and N as input parameters 
and returns an integer, the number of N-divisor 
number in between A and B inclusive.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O((B-A) sqrt (B))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:

1<=A<=B<=10^4
1 <= N <= 16
