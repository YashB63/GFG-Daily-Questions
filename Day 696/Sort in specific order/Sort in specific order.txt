Given an array arr[] of positive integers. 

Your have to sort them so that the first part 
of the array contains odd numbers sorted in 
descending order, and the rest of the portion 
contains even numbers sorted in ascending order.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 10]

Output: [7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 10]

Explanation: 7, 5, 3, 1 are odd numbers in 
descending order and 2, 4, 10 are even 
numbers in ascending order.


Input: arr[] = [0, 4, 5, 3, 7, 2, 1]

Output: [7, 5, 3, 1, 0, 2, 4]

Explanation: 7, 5, 3, 1 are odd numbers in 
descending order and 0, 2, 4 are even 
numbers in ascending order.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ arri ≤ 10^9
