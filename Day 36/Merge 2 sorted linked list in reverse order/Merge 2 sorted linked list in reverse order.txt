Given two linked lists of size N and M, 
which are sorted in non-decreasing order. 

The task is to merge them in such a way that 
the resulting list is in non-increasing order.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 2, M = 2
list1 = 1->3
list2 = 2->4

Output:
4->3->2->1

Explanation:
After merging the two lists in non-increasing order, 
we have new lists as 4->3->2->1.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 4, M = 3
list1 = 5->10->15->40 
list2 = 2->3->20

Output:
40->20->15->10->5->3->2

Explanation:
After merging the two lists in non-increasing order, 
we have new lists as 40->20->15->10->5->3->2.

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function mergeResult() 
which takes reference to the heads of both linked list 
and returns the pointer to the merged linked list.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N+M)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
0 <= N, M <= 10^4
