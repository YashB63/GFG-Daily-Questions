Given an array of size n containing positive 
integers n and a number k,The absolute 
difference between values at indices i and j 
is |a[i] - a[j]|. 

There are n*(n-1)/2 such pairs and you have to 
print the kth smallest absolute difference among 
all these pairs.


Examples :

Input : n = 4, a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4},  = 3

Output : 1 

Explanation : The possible absolute 
differences are : {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1}. 

The 3rd smallest value among these is 1.


Input : n = 2, a[] = {10, 10}, k = 1

Output : 0


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function kthDiff() 
which takes the array a[], its size n and an 
integer k as inputs and returns the kth smallest 
absolute difference among all these pairs.


Expected Time Complexity: O( N. (Log(n))2 )
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log(n))


Constraints:

1<=n<=10^5
1<=a[i]<=10^5
1 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2
