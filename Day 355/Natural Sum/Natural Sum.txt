Given N, find s such that sum of 
first s natural number is N.
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 10

Output: 4

Explanation: Sum of first 4 natural
number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.   

  
Example 2:

Input: N = 17

Output: -1

Explanaion: There is no such number.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anyhting. 

Your task is to complete the function find() 
which takes N as input parameter and returns s. 

If not possible return -1.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(N))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^9
