Given a string s, the task is to find the 
minimum number of characters to be inserted 
to convert it to a palindrome.

Note: A palindrome is a string that reads the 
same backward as forward for example, strings 
"aba", "abccba" are palindromes


Examples:

Input: s = "abcd"

Output: 3

Explanation: Here we can append 3 characters in the 
beginning and the resultant string will be a palindrome 
"dcbabcd".


Input: s = "aba"

Output: 0

Explanation: Given string is already a 
pallindrome hence no insertions are required.


Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 500
