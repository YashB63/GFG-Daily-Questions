Given an integer n representing number of vertices. 

Find out how many undirected graphs (not necessarily connected) 
can be constructed out of a given n number of vertices.
 

Example 1:

Input: 2

Output: 2


Example 2:

Input: 5

Output: 1024
 

Your Task:

Complete the function count() which takes 
an integer n as input and return the count 
of total number of graphs possible.
