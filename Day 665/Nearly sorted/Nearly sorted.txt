Given an array arr[], where each element is 
at most k positions away from its correct 
position in the sorted order.

Your task is to restore the sorted order 
of arr[] by rearranging the elements in 
place.

Note: Don't use any sort() method.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 4], k = 2

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Explanation: All elements are at most 
k = 2 positions away from their 
correct positions.

Element 1 moves from index 2 to 0
Element 2 moves from index 0 to 1
Element 3 moves from index 1 to 2
Element 4 stays at index 3


Input: arr[]= [7, 9, 14], k = 1

Output: [7, 9, 14]

Explanation: All elements are already 
stored in the sorted order.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ k < arr.size()
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
