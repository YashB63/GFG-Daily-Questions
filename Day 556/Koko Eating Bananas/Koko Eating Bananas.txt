Koko is given an array arr[], where each element represents a pile of bananas. She has exactly k hours to eat all the bananas.

Each hour, Koko can choose one pile 
and eat up to s bananas from it.

If the pile has atleast s bananas, 
she eats exactly s bananas.

If the pile has fewer than s bananas, 
she eats the entire pile in that hour.

Koko can only eat from one pile per hour.

Your task is to find the minimum value 
of s (bananas per hour) such that Koko 
can finish all the piles within k hours.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 3], k = 4

Output: 5

Explanation: Koko eats at least 5 bananas 
per hour to finish all piles within 4 hours, 
as she can consume each pile in 1 + 2 + 1 = 
4 hours.


Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 15, 20], k = 7

Output: 10

Explanation: At 10 bananas per hour, 
Koko finishes in 6 hours, just within 
the limit 7.


Constraint:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5 
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
arr.size() ≤ k ≤ 10^6
