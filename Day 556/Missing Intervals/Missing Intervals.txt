Given a sorted array arr[] of integers 
varying from range l to r. 

Find all the missing intervals range in 
array arr[] from the given range and 
return in sorted order.

Note: If no Integer is missing return {-1,-1}.


Example 1:

Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 6, 7, 9], l = 1, r = 9

Output: [{2, 4}, {8, 8}]

Explanation: all the missing intervals which 
are not present in array are returned.


Example 2:

Input: arr[] = [3, 4, 5, 5], l = 3, r = 5 

Output: [{-1,-1}]

Explanation: There are no missing 
number from the interval. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^6
