Given an even sized array arr[], where each consecutive pair of 
elements represents a height with two fields: feet and inches. 

Find the maximum height, where the height is calculated by 
converting feet to inches and adding the inches.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 1] 

Output: 25

Explanation: (1, 2) and (2, 1) are respective given heights. 

After converting both heigths in to inches, we get 14 and 25 
as respective heights. 

So, 25 is the maximum height.


Input: arr[] = [3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2]

Output: 38

Explanation: (3, 2), (2,3) and (1, 2) are respective given heights. 

After converting both heigths in to inches, we get 38, 27 and 14 
as respective heights. 

So, 38 is the maximum height.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

2 <= arr.size() <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
