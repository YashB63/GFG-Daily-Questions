Geek is very fond of patterns. 

Once, his teacher gave him a pattern to solve. 

He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to 
build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a star pattern.


Example 1:

Input: 5

Output:
*

Your Task:

You don't need to input anything. 

Complete the function printTriangle() 
which takes an integer n as the input 
parameter and prints the pattern.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000
