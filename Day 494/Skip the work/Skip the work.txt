Given an array A[ ] denoting the time 
taken to complete N tasks, determine 
the minimum amount of time required 
to finish the tasks considering that 
you can skip any task, but skipping 
two consecutive tasks is forbidden.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
A[] ={10,20}

Output: 10

Explanation: we can take time of
10 units and skip 20 units time.


â€‹Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
A[] = {10,5,7,10}

Output: 12

Explanation: we can skip both the
tens and pick 5 and 7 only.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function minAmount() 
which accepts array A[] and its size N as input 
parameter and returns minimum amount of time 
required to finish the tasks.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
