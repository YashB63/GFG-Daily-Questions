Given a string with brackets ('[' and ']') and 
the index of an opening bracket. 

Find the index of the corresponding closing bracket.


Example 1:

Input:
S = "[ABC[23]][89]"
pos = 0
Output: 8
Explanation: [ABC[23]][89]
The closing bracket corresponding to the
opening bracket at index 0 is at index 8.


Example 2:

Input: 
S = "ABC[58]"
pos = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: ABC[58]
The closing bracket corresponding to the
opening bracket at index 3 is at index 6.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function closing() 
which takes a string S and a position pos as inputs 
and returns the index of the closing bracket 
corresponding to the opening bracket at index pos.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 2*10^5
