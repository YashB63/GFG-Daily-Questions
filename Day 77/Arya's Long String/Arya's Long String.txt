Arya has a string, s, of uppercase English letters. 
She writes down the string s on a paper k times. 
She wants to calculate the occurence of a specific letter  
in the first n characters of the final string.


Example 1:

Input : 
s = "ABA"
k = 3
n = 7
c = 'B'
Output : 
2
Explaination : 
Final string - ABAABAABA


Example 2:

Input : 
s = "MMM"
k = 2
n = 4
c = 'M'

Output :
4

Explaination : 
Final string - MMMMMM

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function fun() 
which takes the string s , integer k ,integer n 
and the character c as input parameter and 
returns the occurence of the character c  
in the first n characters of the final string.

Expected Time Complexity : O(|s|)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= |s| <= 10^5
1 <= k <= 10^5
1 <= n <= |s|*k
