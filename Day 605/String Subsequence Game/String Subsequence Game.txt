Given a string return all unique possible 
subsequences which start with vowel and 
end with consonant. 

A String is a subsequence of a given String, 
that is generated by deleting some character 
of a given string without changing its order.

NOTE: Return all the unique subsequences 
in lexicographically sorted order. 


Example 1:

Input: S = "abc"

Output: "ab", "ac", "abc" 

Explanation: "ab", "ac", "abc" are 
the all possible subsequences which 
start with vowel and end with consonant.


Example 2:

Input: S = "aab"

Output: "ab", "aab"

Explanation: "ab", "aab" are the all 
possible subsequences which start 
with vowel and end with consonant.


Your Task:
  
You dont need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function allPossileSubsequences() 
which takes S as input parameter and returns 
all possible subsequences which start with 
vowel and end with consonant.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n*logn*2^n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(2^n)


Constraints:
1<= |S| <=18
