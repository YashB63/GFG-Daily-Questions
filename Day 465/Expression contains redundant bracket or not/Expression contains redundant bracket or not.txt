Given a string of balanced expression str, 
find if it contains a redundant parenthesis 
or not. 

A set of parenthesis are redundant if the same 
sub-expression is surrounded by unnecessary or 
multiple brackets. 

Return 1 ifit contains a redundant parenthesis, else 0.

Note: Expression may contain + , - , *, and / operators. 

Given expression is valid and there 
are no white spaces present.


Example 1:

Input:
exp = ((a+b))

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
((a+b)) can reduced to (a+b).


Example 2:

Input:
exp = (a+b+(c+d))

Output:
No

Explanation:
(a+b+(c+d)) doesn't have any redundant or multiple
brackets.


Your task:

You don't have to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function checkRedundancy() 
which takes the string s as input and returns 1 if it 
contains redundant parentheses else 0.


Constraints:

1<=|str|<=10^4


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
