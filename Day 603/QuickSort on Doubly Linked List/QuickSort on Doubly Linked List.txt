Sort the given doubly linked list using quicksort. 

Just complete the partition function using the 
quicksort technique.


Example:

Input: LinkedList: 4->2->9

Output: 2->4->9

Explaination: After sorting output will look like this.


Input:

LinkedList: 1->4->9->2

Output: 1->2->4->9

Explaination: After sorting output will look like this.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= no. of nodes <= 10^6
1 <= node->data <= 10^6
