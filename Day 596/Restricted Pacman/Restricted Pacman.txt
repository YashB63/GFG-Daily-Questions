In the game of Restricted Pacman, 
an infinite linear path is given. 

Pacman has to start at position 0 and 
eat as many candies as possible. 

In one move he can only jump 
a distance of either m or n.  

If m and n are coprime numbers, find how many 
candies will be left on the board after the 
game is over.

Note: The result is always finite as after a point 
x every index in the infinite path can be visited. 


Examples:

Input: m= 2, n= 5

Output: 2

Explanation: From index 0, the indices that can be visited are
0 + 2 = 2
0 + 2 + 2 = 4
0 + 5 = 5
0 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
0 + 2 + 5 = 7
0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
0 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 9
0 + 5 + 5 = 10
and so on.

1 and 3 are the only indices that cannot be visited. 

Therefore the candies at these two positions will 
be left on the board. 


Input: m = 2, n = 7

Output: 3 

Explanation : From index 0,the indices that can be visited are 
0 + 2 = 2
0 + 2 + 2 = 4
0 + 2 + 2 + 2 =6
0 + 7 = 7
0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
0 + 2 + 7 = 9
and so on.

1 ,3 and 5 are the only indices that cannot be visited.

Therefore the candies at these two postions will be 
left on the board
