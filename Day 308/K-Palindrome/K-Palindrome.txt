Given a string s containing n lowercase alphabets 
and an integer k, a string is considered a "k-palindrome" 
if it can be converted into a palindrome by removing 
no more than k characters. 

Your task is to determine whether the given string 
s can be made into a k-palindrome or not.


Example 1:

Input: 
s = abcdecba
k = 1

Output: 
true

Explanation: 
Since k = 1, by removing either 'd' or 'e', 
the string can become a palindrome. 

- Hence answer is true.

Example 2:

Input: 
s = abcd
k = 2

Output: 
false

Explanation: 
Since k = 2, we can remove at most 2 characters. 

but for given string it is impossible to make it 
palindrome by removing at most 2 characters.

- Hence answer is false.


Your Task:

The task is to complete the function iskPalindrome() 
which takes a string s and an integer k as input 
parameters and returns the true if s is k-palindrome, 
else false.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
0 ≤ k ≤ n
