Given an array arr[] containing integers,  
your task is to print the array in the order â€“ 
smallest number, largest number, 2nd smallest number, 
2nd largest number, 3rd smallest number, 
3rd largest number and so on.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6, 5]

Output: [1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6, 5]

Explanation: Smallest number is 1. 

Largest number is 9. 

2nd smallest number is 2. 

Then 2nd largest number is 8. And so on.


Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]


Expected Time Complexity: O(n*logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints: 
1 <= arr.size()<= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <=10^6
