Given two numbers a and b; you need to perform 
basic mathematical operation on them. 

You will be provided an integer named as operator. 

If operator equals to 1 add a and b, 
then print the result as a string.

If operator equals to 2 subtract b from a, 
then print the result as a string.

If operator equals to 3 multiply a and b, 
then print the result as a string.

If operator equals to any another number, 
print "Invalid Input"(without quotes).

Note: Do not add a new line at the end


Examples:

Input: a = 1, b = 2, opr = 3

Output: 2

Explanation: 1 * 2 = 2


Input: a = 2, b = 2, opr = 2

Output: 0

Explanation: 2 - 2 = 0


Constraints: 
-100 ≤ a,b ≤ 100
