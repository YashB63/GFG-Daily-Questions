Given an array arr[] where each element denotes the length of a board, 
and an integer k representing the number of painters available. 

Each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit length of a board.

Determine the minimum amount of time required to paint 
all the boards, under the constraint that each painter 
can paint only a contiguous sequence of boards 
(no skipping or splitting allowed).


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 30, 20, 15], k = 3

Output: 35

Explanation: The optimal allocation of boards among 3 painters is - 
Painter 1 → [5, 10] → time = 15
Painter 2 → [30] → time = 30
Painter 3 → [20, 15] → time = 35
Job will be done when all painters finish i.e. at time = max(15, 30, 35) = 35


Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40], k = 2

Output: 60

Explanation: A valid optimal partition is - 
Painter 1 → [10, 20, 30] → time = 60
Painter 2 → [40] → time = 40
Job will be complete at time = max(60, 40) = 60


Input: arr[] = [100, 200, 300, 400], k = 1

Output: 1000

Explanation: There is only one painter, so the 
painter must paint all boards sequentially. 

The total time taken will be the sum of all board 
lengths, i.e., 100 + 200 + 300 + 400 = 1000.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5
