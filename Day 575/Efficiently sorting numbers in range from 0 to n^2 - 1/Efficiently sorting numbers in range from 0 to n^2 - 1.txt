Given an array of numbers of size N. 

It is also given that the array elements 
are in range from 0 to N2 â€“ 1. 

Sort the given array in linear time.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
arr[] = {40, 12, 45, 32, 33, 1, 22}

Output: 1 12 22 32 33 40 45

Explanation: Output is the sorted version of the
given array.


Example 2:

Input: 
N = 5
arr[] = {24, 12, 0, 15, 8}

Output: 0 8 12 15 24

Explanation: Output is the sorted version of the
given array.


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function sort () 
which takes an array arr[] and its size N as 
inputs and sorts the array in non-decreasing 
order. 

Note: You have to modify the input array such 
that it becomes sorted in non-decreasing order.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N). 
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^4
