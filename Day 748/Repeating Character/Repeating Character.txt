Given a string s, return the index of the first character 
that appears more than once in the string. 

If there is no repeated character, return -1.


Examples:

Input: s = "geeksforgeeks"

Output: 0

Explanation: We see that both 'e' and 'g' repeat 
as we move from left to right.But the leftmost is 
'g' so we return leftmost index of 'g' that is 0.


Input: s = "abcd"

Output: -1

Explanation: No character repeats so we return -1.


Constraints:
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5
