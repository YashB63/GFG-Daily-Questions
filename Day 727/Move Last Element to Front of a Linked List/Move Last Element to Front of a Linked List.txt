You are given the head of a Linked List. 

You have to move the last element to the 
front of the Linked List and return the 
head the modified linked list.


Examples:

Input: Linked List: 2->5->6->2->1

Output: 1->2->5->6->2

Explanation: In the given linked list, the last element is 1, 
after moving the last element to the front the linked list 
will be 1->2->5->6->2


Input: Linked List: 2

Output: 2

Explanation: Here 2 is the only element so, the linked list will remain the same.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= size of linked list <= 10^6
0 <= elements of list <= 10^9
