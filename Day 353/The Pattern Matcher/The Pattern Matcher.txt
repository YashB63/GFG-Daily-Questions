All right! Let's implement some 
pattern-matching using CPP strings.

You are given a string s of x and y. 

You need to verify whether the 
string follows the pattern xnyn. 

That is the string is valid only if equal 
number of ys follow equal number of xs.

As an example: xxyyxxyy is valid. xy is valid. 

xxyyx is invalid. xxxyyyxxyyxy is valid.


Example 1:

Input:s = xxyyOutput:1


Example 2:

Input:s = xyxOutput:0


Your Task:

Since this is a function problem, 
you don't need to take any input. 

Just complete the function follPatt(string s) 
that outputs 1 if string is valid, else 
it outputs 0. 

In a new line, print 1 if the 
string is valid else print 0.


Expected Time Complexity:O(|s|)
Expected Auxilary Space:O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= |s| <=100
