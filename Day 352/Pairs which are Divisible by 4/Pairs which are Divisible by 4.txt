Given an array arr[] of positive integers, 
count the number of pairs of integers in 
the array that have the sum divisible by 4.


Examples:

Input : arr[] = [2, 2, 1, 7, 5]

Output : 3

Explanation: (2,2), (1,7) and (7,5) are the 3 pairs.


Input : arr[] = [2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

Output : 4

Explanation: (2,2), (2,6), (3,5) and (2,6) are the 4 pairs.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
