Check if the binary representation of 
a number is palindrome or not.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 17

Output:
1

Explanation:
(17)10 = (10001)2
Which is pallindrome hence
output is 1.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 16

Output:
0

Explanation:
(16)10 = (10000)2
Which is not pallindrome 
hence output is 0.


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function isPallindrome() 
which takes an integer N as input parameters and 
returns 1 if the binary equivalent of N is a palindrome.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(logN)
 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^18
