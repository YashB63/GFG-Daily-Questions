Given a string S, in an operation you can remove 3 
consecutive characters which are duplicates and 
concatenate the rest string. 

You can perform this operation any number of times. 
Find the reduced string.

Note: Return '-1' if the string is 
empty after removing the duplicates.


Example 1:

Input: S = "aabbbaccddddc"

Output: ccdc

Explanation: First remove 3 consecutive
b's and d's and then a's


Example 2:

Input: S = "aabbaccddc"

Output: aabbaccddc

Explanation: No three consecutive 
duplicates exists

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function 
remove3ConsecutiveDuplicates() which takes a 
string S as input and returns the string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|).


Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 10^5
S contains lower case English alphabets
