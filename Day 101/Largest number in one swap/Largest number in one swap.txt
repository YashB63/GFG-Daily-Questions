Given a non-negative number N in the form of a string.

Find the largest number that can be formed 
by swapping two characters at most once.


Example 1:

Input:
N=768

Output:
867

Explanation:
Swapping the 1st and 3rd 
characters(7 and 8 respectively),
gives the largest possible number.


Example 2:

Input:
N=333

Output:
333

Explanation:
Performing any swaps gives the 
same result i.e 333.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function LargestSwap() 
which takes the string N as input parameter and 
returns the maximum possible string possible 
with at most one swap.

Expected Time Complexity:O(|N|)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)

Constraints:
1<=|N|<=10^5
