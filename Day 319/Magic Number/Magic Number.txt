A magic number is defined as a number that can be 
expressed as a power of 5 or sum of unique powers 
of 5. 

First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 
130(125 + 5), …

Given the value of n, find the n'th Magic number modulo 10^9+7.


Example 1:

Input: n = 1

Output: 5

Explanation: 1'st Magic number is 5.


Example 2:

Input: n = 2

Output: 25

Explanation: 2'nd Magic number is 25. 


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function nthMagicNo() 
which takes n input and returns the answer with 
modulo 10^9+7.


Expected Time Complexity: O(log n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
