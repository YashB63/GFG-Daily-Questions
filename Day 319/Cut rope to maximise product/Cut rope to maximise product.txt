Given a rope of length n meters, cut the rope into 
several ropes of varying lengths to maximize the 
product of lengths of all resulting ropes. 

It is mandatory to make at least one cut.


Examples:

Input: n = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: Since 1 cut is mandatory. 

Maximum obtainable product is 1*1 = 1.


Input: n = 5

Output: 6

Explanation: Maximum obtainable product is 2*3 = 6.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
