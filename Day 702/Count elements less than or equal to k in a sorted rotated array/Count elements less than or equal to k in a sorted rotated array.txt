Given a sorted array arr[] containing distinct 
positive integers that has been rotated at some 
unknown pivot, and a value x. 

Your task is to count the number of elements in 
the array that are less than or equal to x.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 5, 8, 1, 3], x = 6

Output: 4

Explanation: 1, 3, 4 and 5 are less than 6, 
so the count of all elements less than 6 is 4.


Input: arr[] = [6, 10, 12, 15, 2, 4, 5], x = 14

Output: 6

Explanation: All elements except 15 are less than 14, 
so the count of all elements less than 14 is 6.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ arr[i], x ≤ 10^9
