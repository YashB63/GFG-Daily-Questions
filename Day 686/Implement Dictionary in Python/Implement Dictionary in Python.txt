You are familiar with most of the properties of 
dictionaries in Python. 

Let's get this into head by solving a problem.

You are given a list of student names (keys) 
and their corresponding marks (values). 

The task is to do operations as described below:

k key, v value: Insert given key k and value v in 
the dictionary, print 'Inserted' after inserting.

d key: Delete the entry for a given key d and print 'Deleted' 
if the key to be deleted is present, else print '-1'.

p key: Print marks of given key p in statement 
as "Marks of {student_name} is : {marks}". 

If key is not present print '-1'.

Note: Avoid using F-string in your 
python solution code. 

Use normal string concatenation instead.


Examples:

Input:
dhi ankit
100 200
harsh 300
harsh
harsh

Output:
Inserted
Deleted
-1

Explanation: First two lines take my_dict input as key and values. 

Then, insert and del operation happens, 
correspondingly Inserted and Deleted is 
printed. 

For last query, harsh key is not present 
so -1 is printed.


Input:
harsh ghutra mith
100 200 300
ankit 400
mith
ankit

Output:
Inserted
Deleted
Marks of ankit is 400

Explanation: First two lines take 
my_dict input as key and values. 

Then, insert and del operation happens, 
correspondingly Inserted and Deleted is 
printed. 

For last query, Marks of ankit is 400 is printed.


Constraints:
1 <= | key | <= 20
1 <= marks <= 10^5
