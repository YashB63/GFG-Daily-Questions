Given an array arr[] of length n used to denote the 
dimensions of a series of matrices such that the 
dimension of i'th matrix is arr[i] * arr[i+1]. 

There are a total of n-1 matrices. 

Find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices 
together. 

Your task is to return the string which is formed of 
A - Z (only Uppercase) denoting matrices & Brackets
( "(" ")" ) denoting multiplication symbols. 

For example, if n = 11, the matrixes can be denoted 
as A - K as n <= 26 & multiplication of A and B is 
denoted as (AB).

NOTE:

Each multiplication is denoted by putting open 
& closed brackets to the matrices multiplied & 
also, please note that the order of matrix 
multiplication matters, as matrix multiplication 
is non-commutative A*B != B*A

As there can be multiple possible answers, 
the console would print "true" for the 
correct string and "false" for the incorrect 
string. 

You need to only return a string that performs 
a minimum number of multiplications.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [40, 20, 30, 10, 30]

Output: true

Explanation: Let's divide this into matrix
(only 4 are possible) [ [40, 20] -> A, 
[20, 30] -> B, [30, 10] -> C, [10, 30] -> D ]

First we perform multiplication of B & C -> (BC), 
then we multiply A to (BC) -> (A(BC)), then we 
multiply D to (A(BC)) -> ((A(BC))D)

So the solution returned the string ((A(BC))D), 
which performs minimum multiplications. 

The total number of multiplications are 20*30*10 + 
40*20*10 + 40*10*30 = 26,000.


Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]

Output: true

Explanation: There is only one way to multiply two matrices: 
(AB): The cost for the multiplication will be 6000


Input: arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]

Output: true

Explanation: There are two possible 
ways to multiply three matrices:

((AB)C): The cost for the multiplication will be 18,000

(A(BC)): The cost for the multiplication will be 32,000

So the solution returned the string ((AB)C), 
which performs minimum multiplications.


Constraints:

2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 50
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 100
