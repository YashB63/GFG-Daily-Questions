Given two strings X and Y, the task is 
to check if it is possible to convert 
X to Y by performing the following 
operations.

 Make some lowercase letters uppercase.

 Delete all the lowercase letters.

NOTE: You can perform one,two or none 
operations to convert the string X to 
Y as needed.


Example 1:

Input: X = "daBcd", Y = "ABC"

Output: 1

Explanation: Convert 'a' and 'c', delete
both the d's


Example 2:

Input: X = "ABcd", Y = "BCD"

Output: 0

Explanation: Can not delete A


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
stringConversion() which takes the 
strings as input and returns 1 if it 
is possible to convert, otherwise 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|X|*|Y|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|X|*|Y|)


Constraints:
1 ≤ |X|, |Y| ≤ 10^3
