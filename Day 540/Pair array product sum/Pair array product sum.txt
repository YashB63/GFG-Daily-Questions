Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. 

Count the number of pairs {i, j} in the array 
such that arr[i] + arr[j] < arr[i] * arr[j].

Note: the pair {i, j} and {j, i} are considered 
the same and i should not be equal to j.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 4, 5]

Output: 3

Explanation: Pairs are {3, 4}, 
{4, 5}, and {3,5}.  


Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1]

Output: 0

Explanation: No pairs can be formed 
which satisfy the condition. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
