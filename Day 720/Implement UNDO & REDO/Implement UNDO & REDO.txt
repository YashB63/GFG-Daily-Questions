You are given a text document that is initially empty. 

You need to complete the following functions:

void append(char x) - Append the character 
x to the end of the document.

void undo() - Undo the most recent APPEND operation 
(remove the last appended character).

void redo() - Reapply the most recent undone operation 
(restore the last character removed by UNDO).

string read() - Return the current content of the document as a string.

There will be a sequence of q queries arr[] on the document. 

The queries are represented in numeric form:

1 x - Call append(x)
2 - Call undo()
3 - Call redo()
4 - Call read()

The driver code will process the queries, 
call the corresponding functions, and 
finally print the outputs of all READ() 
operations.

You only need to implement the above four functions.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [[1 'A'], [1 'B'], [1 'C'], [2], [4], [3], [4]]

Output: ["AB", "ABC"]

Explanation: For each query following changes are made into the document.
1st query: Append('A'), Document contains "A".
2nd query: Append('B'), Document contains "AB".
3rd query: Append('C'), Document contains "ABC".
4rth query: UNDO(), Last character is removed, Document contains "AB".
5th query: READ(), Document content will be printed.
6th query: REDO(), Document contains "ABC".
7th query: READ(), Document content will be printed.


Input: arr[] = [[1 'D'], [2], [4]]

Output: [""]

Explanation: Queries will be processed as:
1st query: Append('D'), Document contains "D".
2nd query: UNDO(), Last character is removed, Document becomes empty.
3rd query: READ(), Empty Document will be printed.


Constraints:
1 ≤ q ≤ 10^4
