Write a program to calculate nPr . 

nPr  represents n permutation r and 
value of nPr  is (n!) / (n-r)!.


Examples:

Input: n = 5, r = 2

Output: 2

Explaination: 5!/(5-2)! = 5!/3! = 120/6 = 20.


Input: n = 6, r = 3

Output: 6

Explaination: 6!/(6-3)! = 6!/3! = 720/6 = 120.


Constraints:
1 ≤ n, r ≤ 20
