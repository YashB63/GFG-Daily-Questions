You are given a number n. 

Find the total count of set 
bits for all numbers from 1 
to n (both inclusive).


Examples :

Input: n = 4

Output: 5

Explanation: For numbers from 1 to 4. 

for 1: 0 0 1 => 1 set bit, for 2: 0 1 0 => 1 
set bit, for 3: 0 1 1 => 2 set bits, 
for 4: 1 0 0 => 1 set bit. 

Therefore, the total set bits are 5.


Input: n = 17

Output: 35

Explanation: From numbers 1 to 17
(both inclusive), the total number 
of set bits are 35.


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^8
