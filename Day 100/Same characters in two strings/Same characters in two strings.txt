Given two strings A and B of equal length, 
find how many times the corresponding position 
in the two strings hold exactly the same character. 

The comparison should not be case sensitive. 


Example 1:

Input:
A = choice 
B = chancE
Output: 4
Explanation: characters at position 0, 1, 4 and 5
are same in the two strings A and B.


Example 2:

Input:
A = Geek 
B = gang

Output: 1

Explanation: charactera at position 0 is the
same in the two strings A and B.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. 
Complete the function sameChar() which takes the 
two strings A and B as input parameters and 
returns the count of the characters 
that are same in A and B.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N) 
where N is the length of strings A and B.

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) 


Constraints:
1<= A.length(), B.length() <= 10^4
