Given string str, transform it according to the following rules:

Delete all the vowels from the string.

Insert # in front of all the consonants.

Change the case of all the letters of the string. 


Example 1:

Input:
str = aBAcAba

Output: #b#C#B

Explanation: Vowels at position 0,2,4,6 are deleted.
'#' is added before consonants at position 1,3,5 
and their case is changed.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Complete the function transform() which 
takes the string str as an input parameter 
and returns the transformed string. 

If the resulting string is empty return "-1".


Expected Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the length of str.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)  


Constraints:
1<= str.length() <= 10^4
