Write a program that receives a number n as input and 
prints it in the following format as shown below.

Like for n = 2 the pattern will be:

1*2*5*6
--3*4


Example 1:

Input: n = 3

Output: 
1*2*3*10*11*12
--4*5*8*9
----6*7

Explanation: If the pattern shown in question 
is followed, this will be the output.


Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function pattern() 
which takes n as input parameter and returns a 
list of string where each string denotes a new 
line of the pattern.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n^2)


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 70
