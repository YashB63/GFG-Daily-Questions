You are given a root of  binary tree and an integer x. 

Your task is to count the number of subtrees whose sum 
of all node values is exactly equal to x.

Note: A subtree is formed by a node in the binary 
tree together with all of its descendants. 

The sum of a subtree is the sum of all node 
values within it.


Examples:

Input: root = [5, -10, 3, 9, 8, -4, 7 ], x = 7

Output: 2

Explanation: Subtrees with sum 7 are [9, 8, -10] and [7].


Input: root = [1, 2, 3], x = 5

Output: 0

Explanation: No subtree has sum equal to 5.


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5
-10^5 ≤ node value ≤ 10^5
