Given an Array Arr of N positive integers 
and an integer X. 

Return the frequency of X in the array.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Arr = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
X = 1

Output: 
5

Explanation: Frequency of 1 is 5.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 6
Arr = {1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1}
X = 2

Output: 
2

Explanation: Frequency of 2 is 2.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function 
findFrequency() which should return the frequency of X.

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Arr[i] <= 10^5
1 <= X <= 10^5
