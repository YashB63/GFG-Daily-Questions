Given a string s, return the lexicographically 
largest string that can be obtained by swapping 
at most one pair of characters in s.


Examples:

Input: s = "768"

Output: "867"

Explanation: Swapping the 1st and 3rd 
characters(7 and 8 respectively), 
gives the lexicographically largest 
string.


Input: s = "333"

Output: "333"

Explanation: Performing any swaps 
gives the same result i.e "333".


Constraints:

1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5
'0' ≤ s[i] ≤ '9'
