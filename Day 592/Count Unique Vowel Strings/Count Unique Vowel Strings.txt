You are given a lowercase string s, determine 
the total number of distinct strings that can 
be formed using the following rules:

Identify all unique vowels (a, e, i, o, u) 
present in the string.

For each distinct vowel, choose exactly 
one of its occurrences from s. 

If a vowel appears multiple times, each occurrence 
represents a unique selection choice.

Generate all possible permutations of the selected vowels. 

Each unique arrangement counts as a distinct string.

Return the total number of such distinct strings.


Examples:

Input: s = "aeiou"

Output: 120

Explanation: Each vowel appears once, 
so the number of different strings 
can form is 5! = 120.


Input: s = "ae"

Output: 2

Explanation: Pick a and e, 
make all orders → "ae", "ea".


Input: s = "aacidf"

Output: 4 

Explanation: Vowels in s are 'a' and 'i', 
Pick each 'a' once with a single 'i', make 
all orders → "ai", "ia", "ai", "ia".


Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 100
