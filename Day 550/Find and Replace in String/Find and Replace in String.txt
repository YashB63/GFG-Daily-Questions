Given a string S on which you need 
to perform Q replace operations.

Each replacement operation has 3 parameters: 
a starting index i, a source word x and a 
target word y. 

The rule is that if x starts at position i 
in the original string S, then we will 
replace that occurrence of x with y. 

If not, we do nothing.

Note: All these operations occur simultaneously. 

It's guaranteed that there won't be any 
overlap in replacement: for example, 
S = "abc", indexes = [0,1], sources = 
["ab", "bc"] is not a valid test case.


Example 1:

Input: 
S = "gforks"
Q = 2
index[] = {0, 4}
sources[] = {"g", "ks"}
targets[] = {"geeks", "geeks"}

Output: 
geeksforgeeks

Explanation:
"g" starts at index 0, so, it's replaced by
"geeks". Similarly, "ks" starts at index 4,
and is replaced by "geeks".


Example 2:

Input: 
S = "gforks"
Q = 2
index[] = {0, 3}
sources[] = {"g", "ss"}
targets[] = {"geeks", "geeks"}

Output: 
geeksforks

Explanation:
"g" starts at index 0, so, it's replaced by
"geeks". "ss" doesn't start at index 3 in
original S, so it's not replaced.


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

You only need to complete the function 
findAndReplace() that takes a string S, 
an integer Q, and 3 arrays index, sources, 
and targets of size Q, as input and returns 
the new string after all the operations. 

index[i], sources[i], and targets[i] denotes 
the index, sources, and targets for ith query.


Expected Time Complexity:  O(|S| * Q)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(Q)
 

Constraints:

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ Q ≤ 100
1 ≤ length of sourcesi, targetsi ≤ 100
