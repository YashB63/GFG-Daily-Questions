Given a number, reverse it and add it to 
itself unless it becomes a palindrome or 
return -1 if the number of iterations 
becomes more than 5. 

Return that palindrome number if it becomes 
a palindrome else, it returns -1.


Examples:

Input: n = 23

Output: 55 

Explanation: reverse(23) = 32, then 
32+23 = 55 which is a palindrome. 


Input: n = 73

Output: 121

Explanation: reverse(73) = 37, then 37+73 = 110 which 
is not a palindrome, again reverse(110)= 011, then 
110+11 = 121 which is a palindrome.


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^4
