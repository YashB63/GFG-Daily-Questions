Given a queue q[] of even size. 

Your task is to rearrange the queue by interleaving 
its first half with the second half.

Interleaving is the process of mixing two sequences 
by alternating their elements while preserving their 
relative order.

In other words, Interleaving means place the first 
element from the first half and then first element 
from the 2nd half and again second element from 
the first half and then second element from the 
2nd half and so on....


Examples:

Input: q[] = [2, 4, 3, 1]

Output: [2, 3, 4, 1]

Explanation: We place the first element 
of the first half 2 and after that 
place the first element of second 
half 3 and after that repeat
the same process one more time 
so the resulting queue will be 
[2, 3, 4, 1]


Input: q[] = [3, 5]

Output: [3, 5]

Explanation: We place the first element 
of the first half 3 and first element
of the second half 5 so the resulting 
queue is [3, 5]


Constraints:

1 ≤ queue.size() ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ queue[i] ≤ 10^5
