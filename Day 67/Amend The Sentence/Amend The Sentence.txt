Given a string which is basically a sentence without spaces between words. 
However the first letter of every word is in uppercase. 
You need to print this sentence after following amendments:

(i) Put a single space between these words

(ii) Convert the uppercase letters to lowercase.

Note: The first character of the string can be both uppercase/lowercase.

Your task is to complete the function amendSentence() 
which takes the string s as input and 
returns a string with the stated amendments.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (for output string).
