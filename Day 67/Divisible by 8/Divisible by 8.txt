Given a number S, you need to check whether 
any permutation of the number S divisible by 8 or not. 


Example 1:

Input: S = "80"
Output: "Divisible"
Explanation: 80 is divisible by 8


Example 2:

Input: S = "101"
Output: "Not divisible"
Your Task :
Complete the function isDivisible8() that 
receives a string S denoting the number and 
returns 1 if any permutation of the number is 
divisible by 8 or else returns 0.
