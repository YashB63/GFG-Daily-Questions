Given a string of length N of 
lowercase alphabet characters. 

The task is to complete the function 
countDistinctSubstring(), which returns 
the count of total number of distinct 
substrings of this string.


Input:

The first line of input contains an 
integer T, denoting the number of 
test cases. 

Then T test cases follow. 

Each test case contains a string str.

Output:

For each test case in a new line, 
output will be an integer denoting 
count of total number of distinct 
substrings of this string.


User Task:

Since this is a functional problem you don't 
have to worry about input, you just have to 
complete the function countDistinctSubstring().


Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000


Example(To be used only for expected output):

Input:
2
ab
ababa

Output:
4
10

Exaplanation:

Testcase 1: For the given string "ab" the total 
distinct substrings are: "", "a", "b", "ab".
