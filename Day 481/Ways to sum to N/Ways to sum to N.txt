Given a set of m distinct 
positive integers and a 
value ‘N’. 

Count the total number of 
ways we can form ‘N’ by  
adding the array elements. 

Repetitions and different 
arrangements are allowed.

Note: Answer can be quite large 
output the answer modulo 10^9+7.


Example 1:

Input:
m = 3 , N = 7
Arr[] = {1,5,6}

Output: 6

Explanation: The different ways are:
1+1+1+1+1+1+1
1+1+5
1+5+1
5+1+1
1+6
6+1


â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
m = 3 , N = 3
Arr[] = {1,2,3}

Output: 4

Explanation: The different ways are:
1+1+1
1+2
2+1
3  

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function countWays() 
which accepts array arr[], its size m and integer 
N and returns the total number of ways we can form 
‘N’ by adding array elements.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N*m)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 <= N , m <= 10^3
