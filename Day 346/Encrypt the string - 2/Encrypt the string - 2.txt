You are given a string S. 

Every sub-string of identical letters 
is replaced by a single instance of that 
letter followed by the hexadecimal 
representation of the number of 
occurrences of that letter. 

Then, the string thus obtained is further 
encrypted by reversing it [ See the sample 
for more clarity ]. Print the Encrypted String.

Note: All Hexadecimal letters should 
be converted to Lowercase letters.


Example 1:

Input:
S = "aaaaaaaaaaa"

Output:
ba 

Explanation: 
aaaaaaaaaaa
Step1: a11 (a occurs 11 times)
Step2: a11 is ab [since 11 is b in
hexadecimal]
Step3: ba [After reversing]


Example 2:

Input:
S = "abc"

Output:
1c1b1a

Explanation: 
abc
Step1: a1b1c1
Step2: 1c1b1a [After reversing]
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function encryptString() 
which takes a String S and returns the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints
1 <= |S| <= 10^5
