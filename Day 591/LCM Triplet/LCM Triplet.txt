Given a number n, find the maximum possible 
LCM that can be obtained by selecting three 
numbers less than or equal to n.

Note : LCM stands for Lowest Common Multiple.


Examples:

Input: n = 9

Output: 504

Explanation: 504 is the maximum LCM that 
can be attained by any triplet of numbers 
less than or equal 9. 

The triplet which has this LCM is {7, 8, 9}.


Input: n = 7

Output: 210

Explanation: 210 is the maximum LCM that 
can be attained by any triplet of numbers 
less than or equal 7. 

The triplet which has this LCM is {5, 6, 7}.


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3
