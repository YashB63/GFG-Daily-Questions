Given an array arr containing positive integers. 

Find the maximum sum that can be formed which 
has no three consecutive elements present from 
the array.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]

Output: 5

Explanation: All three element present in 
the array is consecutive, hence we have to 
consider just two element sum having maximum,
which is 2+3 = 5


Input: arr[] = [3000, 2000, 1000, 3, 10]

Output: 5013

Explanation: 3000 + 2000 + 3 + 10 = 5013. 

Here no three elements is consecutive 
in that subsequence.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
