Consider a series of numbers composed 
of only digits 4 and 7. 

First few numbers in the series are 
4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, .. etc. 

Given a string N constructed by 4, 7 digit only, 
find position of this number in this series.
 

Example 1:

Input: N = "7"

Output: 2

Explanation: In the series 4 , 7 , 44 , 47...
7 is at second position.
 

Example 2:

Input: N = "444"

Output: 7

Explanation: In the series 4 , 7 , 44 ,
47 , 74 , 77 , 444 , 447... 444 is at 7th
position 
 

Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function findpos() 
which accepts a string N as input parameter and 
returns the position of that string in the given 
series.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(Length of given string)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 
Constraints:
1 <= Length of String < 50
