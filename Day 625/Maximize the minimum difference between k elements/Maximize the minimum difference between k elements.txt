Given an array arr[] of integers and an integer k, 
select k elements from the array such that the 
minimum absolute difference between any two of the 
selected elements is maximized. 

Return this maximum possible minimum difference.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 6, 2, 5], k = 3

Output: 1

Explanation: 3 elements out of 4 elements are 
to be selected with a minimum difference as 
large as possible. 

Selecting 2, 2, 5 will result in minimum 
difference as 0. 

Selecting 2, 5, 6 will result in minimum 
difference as 6 - 5 = 1.


Input: arr[] = [1, 4, 9, 0, 2, 13, 3], k = 4

Output: 4

Explanation: Selecting 0, 4, 9, 13 will result 
in minimum difference of 4, which is the 
largest minimum difference possible.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
2 ≤ k ≤ arr.size()
