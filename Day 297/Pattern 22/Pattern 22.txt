Geek is very fond of patterns. 

Once, his teacher gave him a square pattern to solve. 

He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build the pattern.


Example 1:

Input: 4

Output:
4 4 4 4 4 4 4
4 3 3 3 3 3 4
4 3 2 2 2 3 4
4 3 2 1 2 3 4
4 3 2 2 2 3 4
4 3 3 3 3 3 4
4 4 4 4 4 4 4


Your Task:

You don't need to input anything. 

Complete the function printSquare() 
which takes  an integer n  as the input
