Given an array arr[] of n weights. 

Find the least weight capacity of a 
boat to ship all weights within d days.

The ith weight has a weight of arr[i]. 

Each day, we load the boat with weights 
given by arr[i].We may not load more 
weight than the maximum weight capacity 
of the ship.

Note: You have to load weights 
on the boat in the given order.

 
Example 1:

Input:
n = 3
arr[] = {1, 2, 1}
d = 2

Output:
3

Explanation:
We can ship the weights in 2 days
in the following way:-
Day 1- 1,2
Day 2- 1


Example 2:

Input:
n = 3
arr[] = {9, 8, 10}
d = 3

Output:
10

Explanation:
We can ship the weights in 3 days
in the following way:-
Day 1- 9
Day 2- 8
Day 3- 10
 

Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
leastWeightCapacity() which takes 2 
integers n, and d, and an array arr 
of size n as input and returns the 
least weight capacity of the boat required.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n*log(Sum of weights - max(list of weights))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ d ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
