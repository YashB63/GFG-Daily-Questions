Given an integer n, write a program to return the factorial of n. 

The Factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers 
from 1 to n.

Note: 0 factorial is equal to 1.


Example:

Input: n = 5

Output: 120

Explanation: 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120


Input: n = 10

Output: 3628800

Explanation: 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 10 = 3628800


Constraints:
0 ≤ n ≤ 10
