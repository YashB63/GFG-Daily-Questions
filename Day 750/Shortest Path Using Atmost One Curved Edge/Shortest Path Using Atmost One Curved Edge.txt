Given an undirected, connected graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 
and E double-edges, represented as a 2D array edges[][]. 

Each double-edge is represented by a tuple (x, y, w1, w2), which indicates 
that there are two edges between vertices x and y: a straight edge with
weight w1 and a curved edge with weight w2.

You are given two vertices a and b and you have to go from a to b through a 
series of edges such that in the entire path, you can use at most 1 curved edge. 

Your task is to find the shortest path from a to b satisfying the above condition.

If no such path exists that satisfies this restriction, return -1.

Note: It is guaranteed that the shortest path value will fit in a 32-bit integer.


Examples:

Input: V = 4, E = 4, a = 1, b = 3, edges[][] = 
[[0, 1, 1, 4], [0, 2, 2, 4], [0, 3, 3, 1], 
[1, 3, 6, 5]]

Output: 2

Explanation:
We can follow the path 1 -> 0 -> 3, this gives a distance 
of 1+3 = 4 if we follow all straight paths. 

But we can take the curved path  from 0 -> 3, which costs 1. 

This will result in a cost of 1 + 1 = 2.


Input: V = 2, E = 1, a = 0, b = 1, edges[][] = [[0, 1, 4, 1]]

Output: 1

Explanation:
Take the curved path from 0 to 1 which costs 1. 


Constraints:

1 ≤ V ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ E ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ a, b ≤ V - 1
0 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] ≤ V-1
0 ≤ edges[i][2], edges[i][3] ≤ 10^4
