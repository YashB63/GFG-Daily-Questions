Note: This POTD is a part 
of Geek Summer Carnival. 

Solve all POTD consecutively from 
5th to 10th April and get a chance 
to win exclusive discount vouchers 
on our GfG courses.

Geek is at the geek summer carnival. 

He is given an array of N strings. 

To unlock exclusive course discounts he 
needs to find the longest common prefix 
among all strings present in the array. 

Can you help him ?


Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
ar[] = {geeksforgeeks, geeks, geek, geezer}

Output:
gee

Explanation: 
Longest common prefix in all the given string is gee. 
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
ar[] = {apple, ape, april}

Output:
ap


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function LCP() that takes integer n 
and ar[] as input parameters and return the LCP 
(in case there is no common prefix return -1). 


Expected time complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected space complexity: O(string length)


Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= String Length <= 100
