A number is a special number if it’s digits 
only consist 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. 

Given a number N and we have 
to find N-th Special Number. 


Example 1:

Input:
N = 6

Output: 5

Explanation: First 6 numbers are
( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )


â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
N = 7

Output: 10

Your task is to complete the function 
getSpecialNumber() which accepts an 
integer N and return Nth Special Number.


Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
