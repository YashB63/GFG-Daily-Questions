Given a number n. 

Return true if the digit sum
(or sum of digits) of n is a 
Palindrome number otherwise false.

A Palindrome number is a number that 
stays the same when reversed


Examples:

Input: n = 56

Output: true

Explanation: The digit sum of 56 is 5+6 = 11. 

Since, 11 is a palindrome number.

Thus, answer is true.


Input: n = 98

Output: false

Explanation: The digit sum of 98 is 9+8 = 17. 
Since 17 is not a palindrome,thus, 
answer is false.


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^9
