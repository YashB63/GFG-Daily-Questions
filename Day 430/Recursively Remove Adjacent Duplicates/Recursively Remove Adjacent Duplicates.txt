Given a string s, remove all its adjacent 
duplicate characters recursively, 
until there are no adjacent duplicate 
characters left.

Note: If the resultant string becomes 
empty, return an empty string.


Examples:

Input: s = "geeksforgeek"

Output: "gksforgk"

Explanation:  g(ee)ksforg(ee)k -> gksforgk


Input: s = "abccbccba"

Output: ""

Explanation: ab(cc)b(cc)ba->abbba->
a(bbb)a->aa->(aa)->""(empty string)


Input: s = "abcd"

Output: "abcd"

Explanation: There are no 
adjacent duplicate characters


Constraints:
1<= s.size() <= 10^5
