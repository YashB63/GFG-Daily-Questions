Write a program to implement a stack using an array oper[]. 

You need  to complete the push(int x) and pop() methods 
inside a class MyStack to simulate the standard stack 
operations:

push(x): Pushes the integer x onto the stack.

pop(): Removes and returns the topmost element of the stack. 

If the stack is empty, return -1.


You will be given a list of space-separated 
queries consisting of two types:

Type 1 : 1 x — Push x into the stack.

Type 2 : 2  — Pop the top element from the stack and print it. 
If the stack is empty, print -1.

Note: It is guaranteed that for Type 1, 
there will always be a value x.


Examples :

Input: oper[] = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2] 

Output: [3, 4]

Explanation: 
push(2)   the stack will be {2}
push(3)   the stack will be {2 3}
pop()     poped element will be 3, the stack will be {2}
push(4)   the stack will be {2 4}
pop()     poped element will be 4


Input: oper[] = [2, 1, 4, 1, 5, 2]

Output: [-1, 5]


Constraints:

1 ≤ numbers of calls made to push, pop ≤ 100
1 ≤ x ≤ 100
