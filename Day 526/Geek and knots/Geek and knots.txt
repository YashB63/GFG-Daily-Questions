Given two walls A, B with M, N hooks respectively. 

You are given K ropes. By using one rope you 
can connect one hook on wall A with another 
hook on wall B. 

One hook can connect with only one rope. 

Find the number of different ways 
you can use all the K ropes.

Two ways that use the exact same set 
of hooks from wall A and wall B are 
considered to be same. 

For Example, 
A1    A2    A3      is same as     A1   A2   A3     and can be ignored.
 |                |                                 |              |      
B1             B2                              B2           B1

Because both knots are using same 
set of wall A hooks (A1, A3) and 
same set of wall B hooks (B1,B2)

Note: Answer can be large, return 
the answer modulo 10^9+7. 


Example 1:

Input:
M = 3, N = 2, K = 2

Output: 3

Explanation: 
hooks on Wall A are A1, A2, A3.
hooks on wall B are B1, B2. 
Different Possible Knots are
K1 = (A1-B1, A2-B2), K2 = (A1-B1, A3-B2), 
K3 = (A2-B1, A3-B2)  
Each of these use different set of hooks from wall A. 


Example 2:

Input:
M = 2, N = 2, K = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: 
A1   A2 
|    | 
B1   B2

There is only one way to select 2 hooks 
from wall A and 2 from wall B. 


Your Task:

You do not need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function knots() which 
takes M, N and K as input parameters and returns the 
number of possible knots. Return the answer modulo 10^9+7.
