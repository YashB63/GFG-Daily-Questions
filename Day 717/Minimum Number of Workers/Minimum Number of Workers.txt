You are given an array arr[], where arr[i] denotes 
the range of working hours a person at position i 
can cover.

If arr[i] ≠ -1, the person at index i can work and 
cover the time interval [i - arr[i], i + arr[i]].

If arr[i] = -1, the person is unavailable 
and cannot cover any time.

The task is to find the minimum number of people 
required to cover the entire working day from 0 
to n - 1. 

If it is not possible to fully cover the day, return -1.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 0]

Output: 1

Explanation: The person at index 1 
can cover the interval [-1, 3]. 

After adjusting to valid bounds, 
this becomes [0, 3], which fully 
covers the entire working day 0 
to n -1. 

Therefore, only 1 person is required 
to cover the whole day.


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, -1, 2, 0, 0, -1, 0]

Output: -1

Explanation: Persons up to index 2 cover interval [0…6], 
but working hour 7 cannot be cover as arr[7] = -1, 
Since the 7th hour cannot be covered by any person, 
it is impossible to cover the full working day.


Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 0, -1]

Output: -1

Explanation: The last hour cannot be covered by 
any person, so it is impossible to cover the 
full working day.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤10^5
-1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ arr.size()
