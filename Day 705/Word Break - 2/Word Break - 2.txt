Given a string s and a dictionary dict[] of valid words, 
you need to return all possible ways to break the string 
s into sentence such that each word in the sentence is a 
valid dictionary word.

You are allowed to use a valid word multiple times in 
the sentence.


Examples:

Input: s = "likegfg", dict[] = ["lik", "like", "egfg", "gfg"]

Output: 
"lik egfg"
"like gfg"

Explanation: All the words in the given 
sentences are present in the dictionary.


Input: s = "geeksforgeeks", dict[] = ["for", "geeks"]

Output: "geeks for geeks"

Explanation: The string "geeksforgeeks" can be broken 
into valid words from the dictionary in one way.


Constraints:

1 ≤ dict.size() ≤ 20
1 ≤ dict[i] ≤ 15
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 500
