Given an integer S. Find the largest even number 
that can be formed by rearranging the digits of S.

Note: In case the number does not contain any even 
digit then output the largest odd number possible.


Example 1:

Input:
S = "1324"

Output: "4312"

Explanation: Largest even number: 4312


Example 2:

Input:
S = "3555"

Output: "5553"

Explanation: No even number possible,
So we'll find largest odd number.


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function LargestEven() 
which takes the string S as inputs representing the 
integer and returns the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S| * log |S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5
S contains only digits from '0' to '9'.
