You are familiar with most of the 
properties of the dictionary in Python. 

Add some more info about dictionaries 
through dictionary formatting and 
deleting key-value pairs.


Formatting:

hash = {}
hash['Geeks'] = 5
hash['geeksforgeeks'] = 13
key = 'Geeks'
s = ("Count of characters is " + 
hash[key] + " in " + key)             
# results in: Count of characters is 
5 in Geeks.

Deleting:

dict = {'a' : 1, 'b': 2, 'c' : 3, 'd' : 4}
del dict['c']          
# delete entry for 'c'


Let's get this into the head by solving a question. 

Given a list of some students in a list and their 
corresponding marks in another list. 

The task is to do some operations as described below:

a. i key value: Iserts key and value in 
the dictionary, and print 'Inserted'.

b. d key: Delete the entry for a given key and 
print 'Deleted' if the key to be deleted is 
present, else print '-1'.

c. key: Print marks of a given key in a statement 
as "Marks of student name is : marks".


Example:

Input:

N = 5
i geeks 100
i for 200
d geeks
i geeks 300
p geeks

Output:

Inserted
Inserted
Deleted
Inserted
Marks of geeks is 300

Explanation:

For first four queries, insert and del 
operation happens, correspondingly Inserted 
And Deleted is printed. For the last query, 
marks of geeks is printed.


Your Task:

Your task is to complete the function insert_dict(), 
del_dict() and print_dict() which should perform the 
operations as required. 

If nothing is printed for a test case, print "-1".


Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= marks <= 10^4
