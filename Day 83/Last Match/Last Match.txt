Given two strings A and B, 
you need to find the last occurrence 
( 1 based indexing) of string B in string A.

 
Example 1:

Input:
A = abcdefghijklghifghsd
B = ghi
Output:
13
Explanation:
ghi occurs at position 13 for the
last time in string A.


Example 2:

Input:
A = abdbccaeab
B = abc

Output:
-1

Explanation:
abc is not a substring of A
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function findLastOccurence() 
which takes two strings A and B as input parameters and 
returns the position of the last occurrence of B in A. 
If B is not present in A, return -1.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(len(A))
Expected Space Complexity: O(len(A))

 

Constarints:
1<=T<=100
1<=len(B)<=10^5
1<=len(A)<=10^6
len(A)>=len(B)
