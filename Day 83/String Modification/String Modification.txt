Given a string with repeated characters, 
the task is to complete the function rearrangeString 
which rearrange characters in a string so that 
no two adjacent characters are same.

Note : It may be assumed that the string has only lowercase 
English alphabets and such transformation is always always possible.


Example 1:

Input:
S = aaabc

Output: 1

Explanation: We can transform the string
to abaca.


Example 2:

Input:
S = aaabb

Output: 1

Explanation: We can transform the string
to ababa.
 

Your Task:
Complete the function rearrangeString() which takes a string 
as an input parameter and returns the rearranged string. 
(The output will be 1 if the returned string has no adjacent character same, 
otherwise 0. Printing is done by the driver's code.)

Expected Time Complexity: O(N * log N), N = length of the string.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(constant)

Constraints:
1< N < 10^5
