Given a linked list, return an integer denoting 
the length of the longest palindrome list that 
exists in the given linked list.


Examples:

Input: Linked List: 2->3->7->3->2->12->24

Output: 5

Explanation: 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 3 -> 2 is the linked 
list whose nodes leads to a palindrome.


Input: Linked List: 12->4->4->3->14

Output: 2

Explanation: 4 -> 4 is the linked list whose 
nodes leads to a palindrome with length 2.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes <= 10^4
1 <= data of nodes <= 10^5
