Given a positive integer N, find the last digit 
of the Nth term from the Fibonacci series.

Note: For N=0 you have to return 0.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5

Output:
5

Explanation:
5th Fibonacci number is 5


Example 2:

Input:
N = 14

Output:
7

Explanation:
14th Fibonacci number is 377
It's last digit is 7


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function fib() which 
takes an integer N as input parameter and returns 
the last digit of Nth Fibonacci number.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 1000
