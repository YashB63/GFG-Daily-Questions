Given an array of length n consisting 
of only 0's and 1's in random order. 

Modify the array in-place to segregate 0s 
on the left side and 1s on the right side of the array.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
arr[] = {0, 0, 1, 1, 0}

Output: {0, 0, 0, 1, 1}

Explanation: 
After segregate all 0's on the left and 1's on 
the right modify array will be {0, 0, 0, 1, 1}.


Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1}

Output: {1, 1, 1, 1}

Explanation: There are no 0 in the given array, 
so the modified array is 1 1 1 1.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function segregate0and1() 
which takes arr[] and n as input parameters and 
modifies arr[] in-place without using any extra memory.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1
