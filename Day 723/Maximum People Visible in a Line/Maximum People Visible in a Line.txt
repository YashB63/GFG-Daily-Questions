You are given an array arr[ ], where arr[i] represents 
the height of the ith person standing in a line.

A person i can see another person j if:

height[j] < height[i],
There is no person k standing between them such that height[k] ≥ height[i].


Each person can see in both directions (front and back).

Your task is to find the maximum number of people 
that any person can see (including themselves).


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6 ]

Output: 6

Explanation:
Person 1 (height = 6) can see five other people at following 
positions (2, 3, 4, 5. 6) in addition to himself, i.e. total 6.
Person 2 (height: 2) can see only himself.
Person 3 (height = 5) is able to see people 2nd, 3rd, and 4th person.
Person 4 (height = 4) can see himself.
Person 5 (height = 5) can see people 4th, 5th, and 6th.
Person 6 (height =1) can only see himself.
Person 7 (height = 6) can see 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th people.
A maximum of six people can be seen by Person 1, 7th


Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 6, 4]

Output: 4

Explanation: 
Person with height 6 can see persons with heights 1, 
3 on the left and 4 on the right, along with himself, 
giving a total of 4.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
