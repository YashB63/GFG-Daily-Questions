Given a singly linked list and a number k. 

Find the (n/k)th element, where n is the number 
of elements in the linked list. 

We need to consider ceil value in case of decimals.


Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6 , k = 2

Output: 3

Explanation: 6/2th element is the 3rd
(1-based indexing) element which is 3.


Input: 2->7->9->3->5 , k = 3

Output: 7

Explanation: The 5/3rd element is the 2nd element 
as mentioned in the question that we need to 
consider ceil value in the case of decimals. 

So 2nd element is 7.


Constraints: 

1 <= number of nodes <= 10^4
1 <= k <= number of nodes
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^3
