Given an integer array arr[ ] and an integer k, 
the task is to check if the array arr[ ] could 
be divided into k non-empty subsets with equal 
sum of elements.

Note: All elements of this array should 
be part of exactly one partition.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 4, 5, 6], k = 3

Output: true

Explanation: We can divide above array into 3 
parts with equal sum as (2, 4), (1, 5), (6)


Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 5, 5, 6], k = 3

Output: false

Explanation: It is not possible to divide 
above array into 3 parts with equal sum.


Constraints:

1 ≤ k ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 100
