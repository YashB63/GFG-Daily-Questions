You are given an integer n representing the number 
of digits in a number, and an array arr[] 
containing digits from 0 to 9. 

Your have to count how many n-digit positive integers 
can be formed such that at least one digit from the 
array arr[] appears in the number.


Examples:

Input: n = 1, arr[] = [1, 2, 3]

Output: 3

Explanation: Only the single-digit numbers 
[1, 2, 3] satisfy the condition.


Input: n = 2, arr[] = [3, 5]

Output: 34

Explanation: There are a total of 34  two digit 
numbers which contain atleast  one out of  [3, 5].


Constraints:

  1 ≤ n ≤ 9
  1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10
  0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 9
