Given an integer n, print all the n digit 
numbers in increasing order, such that 
their digits are in strictly increasing 
order(from left to right).


Example 1:

Input:
n = 1

Output:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Explanation:
Single digit numbers are considered to be 
strictly increasing order.


Example 2:

Input:
n = 2

Output:
12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 23....79 89

Explanation:
For n = 2, the correct sequence is
12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 23 and so on 
up to 89.


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
increasingNumbers() which takes an 
integer n as an input parameter and 
returns the list of numbers such 
that their digits are in strictly 
increasing order.


Expected Time Complexity: O(9^n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 9
