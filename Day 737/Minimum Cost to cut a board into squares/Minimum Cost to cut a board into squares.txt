Given a board of dimensions n × m that needs to be cut into n*m squares. 

The cost of making a cut along a horizontal or vertical edge is 
provided in two arrays:

x[]: Cutting costs along the vertical edges (length-wise).

y[]: Cutting costs along the horizontal edges (width-wise).

Find the minimum total cost required to cut the board into 
squares optimally.


Examples:

Input: n = 4, m = 6, x[] = [2, 1, 3, 1, 4], y[] = [4, 1, 2]

Output: 42

Explanation:

Initially no. of horizontal segments = 1 & no. of vertical segments = 1.

Optimal way to cut into square is:

• Pick 4 (from x) -> vertical cut, Cost = 4 × horizontal segments = 4,
  Now, horizontal segments = 1, vertical segments = 2.
• Pick 4 (from y) -> horizontal cut, Cost = 4 × vertical segments = 8,
  Now, horizontal segments = 2, vertical segments = 2.
• Pick 3 (from x) -> vertical cut, Cost = 3 × horizontal segments = 6,
  Now, horizontal segments = 2, vertical segments = 3.
• Pick 2 (from x) -> vertical cut, Cost = 2 × horizontal segments = 4,
  Now, horizontal segments = 2, vertical segments = 4.
• Pick 2 (from y) -> horizontal cut, Cost = 2 × vertical segments = 8,
  Now, horizontal segments = 3, vertical segments = 4.
• Pick 1 (from x) -> vertical cut, Cost = 1 × horizontal segments = 3,
  Now, horizontal segments = 3, vertical segments = 5.
• Pick 1 (from x) -> vertical cut, Cost = 1 × horizontal segments = 3,
  Now, horizontal segments = 3, vertical segments = 6.
• Pick 1 (from y) -> horizontal cut, Cost = 1 × vertical segments = 6,
  Now, horizontal segments = 4, vertical segments = 6.
So, the total cost = 4 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 8 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 42.


Input: n = 4, m = 4, x[] = [1, 1, 1], y[] = [1, 1, 1]

Output: 15

So, the total cost = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 15.
