Given three numbers a, b, and c. 

You need to find which is the greatest of them all.


Examples:

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

Output: 3

Explanation: Clearly, c = 3 is the greatest of (1, 2, 3)


Input: a = 2, b = 2, c = 5

Output: 5

Explanation: Out of (2, 2, 5) 5 is the greatest.


Constraints:
1 <= a, b, c <= 10^3
