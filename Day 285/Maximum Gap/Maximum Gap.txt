Given an unsorted array arr[] of positive elements. 

Your task is to find the maximum difference between 
the successive elements in its sorted form.

Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 10, 5]

Output: 5

Explanation: The maximum difference between 
successive elements of array is 5 ie abs(5-10).


Input: arr[] = [1, 10, 2]

Output: 8

Explanation: The maximum difference between 
successive elements of array is 8 ie abs(2-10).


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
