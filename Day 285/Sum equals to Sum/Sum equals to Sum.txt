Given an array arr. 

Find if there are two pairs (a, b) and 
(c, d) such that a+b = c+d.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 4, 7, 1, 2, 9, 8] 

Output: true

Explanation: (3, 7) and (9, 1) are the pairs whosesum are equal.  


Input: arr[] = [65, 30, 7, 90, 1, 9, 8]

Output: false

Explanation: There is no pair.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n2).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n2).


Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4
