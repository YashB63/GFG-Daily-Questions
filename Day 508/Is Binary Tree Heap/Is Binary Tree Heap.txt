You are given a binary tree, and the task 
is to determine whether it satisfies the 
properties of a max-heap.

A binary tree is considered a max-heap if 
it satisfies the following conditions:

Completeness: Every level of the tree, 
except possibly the last, is completely 
filled, and all nodes are as far left as 
possible.

Max-Heap Property: The value of each 
node is greater than or equal to the 
values of its children.


Examples:

Input: root[] = [97, 46, 37, 12, 3, 7, 31, 6, 9]
 
Output: true

Explanation: The tree is complete and 
satisfies the max-heap property.


Input: root[] = [97, 46, 37, 12, 3, 7, 31, N, 2, 4] 
 
Output: false

Explanation: The tree is not complete and 
does not follow the Max-Heap Property, 
hence it is not a max-heap.


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^3
