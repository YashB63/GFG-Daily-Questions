The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a 
series of daily price quotes for a stock and we need to 
calculate the span of stock price for all days.

You are given an array arr[] representing daily stock prices, 
the stock span for the i-th day is the number of consecutive 
days up to day i (including day i itself) for which the price 
of the stock is less than or equal to the price on day i. 

Return the span of stock prices for each day in the given sequence.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [100, 80, 90, 120]

Output: [1, 1, 2, 4]

Explanation: Traversing the given input span 100 is greater 
than equal to 100 and there are no more days behind it so 
the span is 1, 80 is greater than equal to 80 and smaller 
than 100 so the span is 1, 90 is greater than equal to 90 
and 80 so the span is 2, 120 is greater than 90, 80 and 
100 so the span is 4. So the output will be [1, 1, 2, 4].


Input: arr[] = [10, 4, 5, 90, 120, 80]

Output: [1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 1]

Explanation: Traversing the given input span 10 is 
greater than equal to 10 and there are no more days 
behind it so the span is 1, 4 is greater than equal 
to 4 and smaller than 10 so the span is 1, 5 is 
greater than equal to 4 and 5 and smaller than 10 
so the span is 2, and so on. 

Hence the output will be [1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 1].


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
