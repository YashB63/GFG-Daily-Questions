Given a stack of integers and Q queries. 

The task is to perform the operation on 
stack according to the query.

The queries can be of 4 types:

i x: (adds element x in the stack).
r: (removes the topmost element from the stack).
h: Prints the topmost element.
f y: (check if the element y is present or not in the stack). 
Print "Yes" if present, else "No". 


Examples:

Input: Q = 6, queries[][] = [[i, 2], [i, 4], [i, 3],[i, 5], [h], [f, 8]]

Output: 5, No

Explanation: Inserting 2, 4, 3, and 5 onto the stack. 

Returning top element which is 5. 

Finding 8 will give No, as 8 is not in the stack.


Input: Q = 4, queries[][] = [[i, 3], [i, 4], [r], [f, 3]]

Output: Yes

Explanation: Inserting 3 and 4 onto the stack. 

Removing 4 from the stack. 

Finding 3 will give Yes as output because 3 is 
available in the stack.


Constraints:
1 ≤ queries.size ≤ 10^3
