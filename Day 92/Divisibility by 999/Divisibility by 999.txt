You are given a large number N in the form of a string, 
you have to check whether it is divisible by 999 
without dividing or finding modulo of number by 999.


Example 1-

Input:
N = 1998
Output:
Divisible
 

Example 2 -

Input:
N = 99999999
Output:
Not divisible
 

Your Task :
Complete the function isDivisible999() 
that receives a string N denoting number and
 returns true if the n is divisible by 999 and 
flse otherwise. 

The driver code itself prints 
"Divisible" if the returned value 
is true and returns "Non Divisible" 
if returned value is false.

 
Expected Time Complexity : O(len(N))
Expected Space Complexity : O(1)


Constraints:
1<=|N|<=10^3
