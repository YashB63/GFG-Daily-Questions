Given a pattern string and a test string, 
If the pattern is preceded by a ^, 
the pattern(excluding the ^) will be matched 
with the starting position of the text string. 
Similarly, if it is preceded by a $, 
the pattern(excluding the ^) will be matched 
with the ending position of the text string. 

If no such markers are present, 
it will be checked whether pattern 
is a substring of test.

 
Example 1:

Input:
P = "^coal"
S = "coaltar"
Output:
1
Explanation:
The pattern "coal" is present at the
beginning of the string, so Output is 1.


Example 2:

Input:
P = "tar$"
S = "coaltar"
Output:
1
Explanation: 
The pattern "tar" is present at the
end of the string, so Output is 1.


Example 3:

Input:
P = "rat"
S = "algorate"
Output:
1
Explanation:
The pattern "rat" is present as a
substring of the string S,
so Output is 1.


Example 4:

Input:
P = "abcd"
S = "efgh"
Output:
0
Explanation:
There is no substring which is equal
to P in string S, so output is 0.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function isPatternPresent() 
which takes Strings P and S as input and returns 0 or 1.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|P|*|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 10^5
1 <= |P| <= 10
String S may contain both Uppercase and Lowercase letters.
