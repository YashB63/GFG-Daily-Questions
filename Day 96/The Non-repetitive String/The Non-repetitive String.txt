Given a string S, the task is to check if a 
string is a non-repetitive or not.  

A non-repetitive string is defined as a string 
that does not contain any different character 
between two same characters


Example 1:

Input: S = "AABBCCCCC"

Output: 1

Explanation: No different character is 
placed between the two same characters.


Example 2:

Input: S = "ABA"

Output: 0

Explanation: B is in between two A's

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function nonRepetitive() 
which takes a string S as input and returns the boolean value.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(constant).


Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 10^5
S contains upper case English alphabets
