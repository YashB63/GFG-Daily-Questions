You are given time for insertion, 
deletion and copying, the task is 
to calculate the minimum time to 
write N characters on the screen 
using these operations. 

Each time you can insert a character, 
delete the last character and copy and 
paste all written characters i.e. after 
copy operation count of total written 
character will become twice.


Example 1:

Input: N = 9, I = 1, D = 2, C = 1  

Output: 5

Explanation: N characters can be written
on screen in 5 time units as shown below,
insert a character    
characters = 1,  total time = 1
again insert character      
characters = 2,  total time = 2
copy characters             
characters = 4,  total time = 3
copy characters             
characters = 8,  total time = 4
insert character           
characters = 9,  total time = 5


Example 2:

Input: N = 1, I = 10, D = 1, C = 5

Output: 10

Explanation: Insert one character


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function minTimeForWritingChars() 
which takes N, I, D and C as input parameters 
and returns the integer value


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
