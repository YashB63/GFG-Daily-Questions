Given a sorted array arr[] of n positive integers 
having all the numbers occurring exactly twice, 
except for one number which will occur only once. 

Find the number occurring only once.


Examples :

Input: n = 5, arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 5, 5}

Output: 2

Explanation: Since 2 occurs once, 
while other numbers occur twice, 
2 is the answer.

Input: n = 7, arr[] = {2, 2, 5, 5, 20, 30, 30}

Output: 20

Explanation: Since 20 occurs once, 
while other numbers occur twice, 
20 is the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O( Log(n) ).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints
0 <  n  <= 10^6
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
