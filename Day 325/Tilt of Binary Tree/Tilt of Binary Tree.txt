Given a binary tree, your task is to complete 
the function tiltTree(), that returns the tilt 
of the whole tree. 

The tilt of a tree node is defined as the 
absolute difference between the sum of all 
left subtree node values and the sum of all 
right subtree node values. 

Null nodes are assigned tilt to be zero. 

Therefore, tilt of the whole tree is defined 
as the sum of all nodesâ€™ tilt.


Examples :

Input: 
       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 1

Explanation: Tilt of node 2 : 0, Tilt of node 3 : 0, 
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1, Tilt of tree : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1


Input:
        4 
       / \
      2   9 
     / \   \
    3   5   7 

Output: 15 

Explanation: Tilt of node 3 : 0 , Tilt of node 5 : 0, 
Tilt of node 7 : 0, Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2, 
Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7, Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = 6, 
Tilt of binary tree : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:

1<= number of nodes <=10^5
0<= node -> data <=10
