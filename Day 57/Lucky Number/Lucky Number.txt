A n digit number has n*(n+1)/2 sub-numbers.  
For example, all possible sub-numbers of 975 are 9 7 5 97 75 975. 
A number is called Lucky if all sub-numbers have different digit product.  
Digit product of a number is product of its digits.  

For example, the number 23 is Lucky.  
Sub-numbers of it are 2, 3 and 23 and digit products are 
2, 3 and 6 respectively (All digit products are different). 
975 is also lucky. Print 1 if given Number is Lucky else Print 0.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 324
Output:
1
Explanation:
All subsequences form different Digit
Products. So, Output is 1.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 323
Output:
0
Explanation:
Subsequences 32, and 23 form same
Digit Product, i.e, 6. So, Output is 0.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function isLuckyOrNot() 
which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.

 
Expected Time Complexity: O((Number of Digits)2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Number of Digits)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^18
