Given an integer N, count the numbers having 
an odd number of factors from 1 to N (inclusive).
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
2
Explanation:
From 1 - 5 only 2 numbers,
1 and 4 are having odd number
of factors.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 1
Output:
1
Explanation:
1 have only 1(odd)
factor

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function count() which 
takes an integer N as input parameters and returns an integer, 
the total count of numbers from 1 to N having an odd number of factors.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(N))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 109
