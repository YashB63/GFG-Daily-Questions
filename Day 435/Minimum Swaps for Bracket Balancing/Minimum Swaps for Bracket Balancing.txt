You are given a string s of 2*n 
characters consisting of n ‘[‘ 
brackets and n ‘]’ brackets. 

A string is considered balanced if 
it can be represented in the form a[b] 
where a and b are balanced strings. 

We can make an unbalanced string balanced 
by swapping adjacent characters. 

Calculate the minimum number of swaps 
necessary to make a string balanced.

Note - Strings a and b can be empty.


Examples :

Input: s = "[]][]["

Output: 2

Explanation: First swap: Position 3 and 4 
[][]][, Second swap: Position 5 and 6 [][][]


Input: s = "[][]"

Output : 0 

Explanation: String is already balanced.


Input: s = "[[[][][]]]"

Output: 0 


Constraints:
1<= s.size() <=10^5
