Writing for loop in Python is a tad different 
from C++ and Java counterparts. 

In this question, we'll learn to 
print table by using the for loop.

You are given a number N, you need to 
print its multiplication table.

Note: Please go through the range function to 
understand why it's useful in for loops.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 5

Output:
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50


Example 2:

Input:
N = 6

Output:
6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60


Your Task:

This is a function problem. 

You don't need to take input of testcases. 

Just complete the function multiplicationTable() 
that takes N as input.


Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^18
