Some cities are going to be renamed and 
accordingly name of their railway stations 
will also change. 

Changing the name of railway station should 
also result in changed station code. 

Railways have an idea that station code should 
be the shortest prefix out of all railway 
stations renamed prior to this. 

If some city has same name, then prefix will be 
the name with suffix as the count of occurence 
of that city prior to this and including this, 
seperated with spaces.

Given N renamed cities consisting 
of lowercase alphabets only. 

The task is to generate a station 
ID for all the stations.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Cities[] = {shimla,safari,jammu,delhi,
                jammu,dehradun}

Output:
s
sa
j
d
jammu 2
deh

Explanation: Till shimla, no stations are there.
So, it's first character will be the unique
smallest prefix. For safari, first character of
shimla matches, so unique smallest prefix is sa
Similarly, j is smallest unique prefix for jammu
and d is for delhi. For last city jammu, we have
countered jammu before, and therefor no smallest
prefix is possible. So, we can generate its code
as jammu with suffix equal to the count of jammu,
i.e, 2. Smallest unique prefix is jammu2. Now,
delhi can be renamed as d, and dehradun can be
renamed as deh, since deh is the smallest non
matching prefix. 


Your Task:

Complete check function which takes array 
of strings and number of string 'n' as 
arguments and print the require answer in 
the function itself. 

You have to provide new line 
in the function itself.


Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^6
1 <= Word Length <= 100


Expected Time Complexity: O(N * WORD_LEN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N * WORD_LEN).
