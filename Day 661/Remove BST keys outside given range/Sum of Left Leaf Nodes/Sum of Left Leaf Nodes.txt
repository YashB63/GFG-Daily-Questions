Given a Binary Tree. 

Find the sum of all the leaf nodes 
that are left child of their parent 
of the given binary tree.


Examples:

Input:
       1
     /   \
    2     3

Output: 2


Input : 
         1
        /  \
       2    3
     /  \     \
    4    5     8 
  /  \        /  \
 7    2      6    9

Output: 13

Explanation: sum = 6 + 7 = 13


Input: 1

Output: 0

Explanation: There is no leaf node, so sum is 0.


Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes <=10^6
1 <= node->data <=10^5
It is guaranteed that sum will not 
exceed integer max value
