Koko is given an array arr[], where each element represents a pile of bananas. She has exactly k hours to eat all the bananas.

Each hour, Koko can choose one pile 
and eat up to s bananas from it.

If the pile has atleast s bananas, 
she eats exactly s bananas.

If the pile has fewer than s bananas, 
she eats the entire pile in that hour.

Koko can only eat from one pile per hour.


Your task is to find the minimum value of s 
(bananas per hour) such that Koko can finish 
all the piles within k hours.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 3], k = 4

Output: 5

Explanation: If Koko eats at the rate of 5 bananas per hour:

First pile of 5 bananas will be finished in 1 hour.

Second pile of 10 bananas will be finished in 2 hours.

Third pile of 3 bananas will be finished in 1 hours.

Therefore, Koko can finish all piles of bananas in 
1 + 2 + 1 = 4 hours.


Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 15, 20], k = 7

Output: 10

Explanation: If Koko eats at the rate of 10 bananas per hour, 
it will take 6 hours to finish all the piles.


Constraint:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ k ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
