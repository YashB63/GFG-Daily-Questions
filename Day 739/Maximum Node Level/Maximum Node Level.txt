Given a Binary tree. 

Find the level in the binary tree which has 
the maximum number of nodes.


Examples:

Input: root = [2, 1, 3, 4, 6, N, 8, N, N, 5]
      2
    /    \ 
   1      3
 /   \     \
4    6      8
     / 
    5

Output: 2

Explanation: The level 2 with nodes 4, 6 and 8 
is the level with maximum number of nodes.
