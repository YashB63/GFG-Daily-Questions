Python has a lot of string methods that can be used 
to manipulate the strings like converting to lowercase, 
capitalizing, trimming the spaces and so on.

In this question, we'll take a look at inbuilt string 
methods like title(), swapcase(), find(), strip().

You'll be given a string str and x, you'll 
perform various operations on them.


Example:

Input:
str = hello 
x = llo

Output:
hello 
2 
Hello 
HELLO


Your Task:
This is a function problem. 

Do not take any input. 

Just Complete the functions trim(), 
exists(), titleIt(), casesSwap().
