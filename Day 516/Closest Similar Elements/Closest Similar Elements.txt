Geek has an integer array arr of size n and 
integers indexDifference, valueDifference. 

Geek needs to find a pair of indexes (i, j) 
which follows all the given conditions

i != j
abs(i - j) <= indexDifference
abs(Arr[i] - Arr[j]) <= valueDifference

Geek needs your help to find out if such a pair, 
return True if such a pair exists else return False.


Examples :

Input: n = 4, arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 1}, indexDifference = 3, 
valueDifference = 0

Output: True

Explanation: The index i = 0 and j = 3 follows all 
the given conditions hence the output is True.


Input: n = 6, arr[] = {1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9}, 
indexDifference = 2, valueDifference = 3

Output: False

Explanation: No pair of indexes follow all the 
given conditions hence the output is False.


Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
-10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
