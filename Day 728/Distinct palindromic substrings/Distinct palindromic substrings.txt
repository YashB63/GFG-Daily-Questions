Given a string s of lowercase English letters. 

The task is to find all the distinct continuous 
palindromic sub-strings which are present in 
the string s.

Note: You can return the Palindromic sub-strings 
in any order but the driver code will print the 
result in sorted order.


Examples:

Input: s = "abaaa"

Output: ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aba", "b"]

Explanation: All 5 distinct continuous 
palindromic sub-strings are listed above.


Input: s = "geek"

Output: ["e", "ee", "g", "k"]

Explanation: All 4 distinct continuous 
palindromic sub-strings are listed above.


Constraints:
1 ≤ s.length() ≤ 10^4
