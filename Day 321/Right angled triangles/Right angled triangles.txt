Given three integers a, b and c. 

The task is to check if it is possible to 
make right angled triangle with sides of 
length a, b and c.

 
Example 1:

Input:
a = 3, b = 4, c = 5

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
We can form a right angled triangle
with sides of length 3, 4 and 5.


Example 2:

Input:
a = 2, b = 5, c = 8

Output:
No

Explanation:
We can't form a right angled triangle
with sides of length 2, 5 and 8.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function rightAngTri() 
which takes 3 Integers a,b and c as input and returns 
"Yes" if it is possible to form a right angled triangle 
with sides of length a, b, and c, else return "No".


Expected Time Complexity: O(log(max(a,b,c)))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= a,b,c <= 10^8
