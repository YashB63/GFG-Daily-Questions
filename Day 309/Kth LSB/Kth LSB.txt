A number N is given. 

Find its Kth Least Significant Bit.


Example 1:

Input: N = 10, K = 4

Output: 1

Explanation: Binary Representation 
of 10 is 1010. 4th LSB is 1.


Example 2:

Input: N = 16, K = 3 

Output: 0 

Explanation: Binary Representation of 
16 is 10000. 3rd LSB is 0.


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function KthLSB() 
which takes the N and K as inputs and returns 
the bit (1 or 0) in K'th LSB.


Expected Time Complexity: O(K)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ K ≤ 32
