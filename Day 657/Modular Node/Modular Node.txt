Given the head of a Singly Linked List and 
a number k, the task is to find the data 
of the modular node of the linked list. 

If no such index is present return -1.

A modular node is defined as the last 
node in the linked list whose index 
is divisible by k (i%k==0). 

Note: 1-based indexing is followed


Examples :

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7 , k = 3
 
Output: 6

Explanation: Indexing of the linked list 
is same as the values of the Node. 

The maximum index which is divisble by 
3 is 6 and thenode value of the 6th 
index is 6.


Input: LinkedList: 19->28->37->46->55 , k = 13

Output: -1

Explanation: Index start from 1 and end at 5. 

There is no index which can divisible by 13, 
so output is -1.


Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes <= 10^5
1 <= node->data , k <= 10^5
