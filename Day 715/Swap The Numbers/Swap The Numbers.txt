Given two numbers a and b, you need to swap 
their values so a holds the value of b and b 
holds the value of a. 

Just write the code to swap values of a and b 
at the specified place.


Examples

Input: a = 1, b = 2

Output: 2 1

Explanation: Initially a = 1 and b = 2, 
now a = 2 and b = 1.


Input: a = 6, b = 7  

Output: 7 6 

Explanation: Initially a = 6 and b = 7, 
now a = 7 and b = 6.
