Given an unsorted array of arr. 

Find the first element in an array such 
that all of its left elements are smaller 
and all right elements of its are greater 
than it.

Note: Return -1 if there is no such element.


Examples : 

Input: arr = [4, 2, 5, 7]

Output: 5

Explanation: Elements on left of 5 are smaller 
than 5 and on right of it are greater than 5.


Input: arr = [11, 9, 12]

Output: -1

Explanation: As no element here which we can 
say smaller in left & greater in right.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:
3 <= arr.size() <= 10^6
1 <= arri <= 10^6
