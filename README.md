# GFG-Daily-Questions
This repository comprises of the daily coding questions solved on GFG platform.

Day 1:

  Q1: Find the Minimum and Maximum Elements in an Array:
  
      Given an array A of size N of integers. 
      Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

  Q2: Missing number in array:

    Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in 
    the range of 1 to N. 
    Find the missing element.

  Q3: Search an element in an array:

    Given an integer array and another integer element. 
    The task is to find if the given element is present in array or not.

Day 2:

  Q1: Wave  Array:

    Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. 
    Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place).
    In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that 
    arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....

    If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.
    
    Note:The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return 
    anything to make changes in the original array itself.

  Q2: Sum of array elements:

    Given an integer array arr of size n, you need to sum the elements of arr.

  Q3: Bitonic Point:

    Given an array arr of n elements that is first strictly increasing 
    and then maybe strictly decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.
    
    Note: If the array is increasing then just print the last element will be the maximum value.
