    Earning Coin: Geek can accumulate coins[i] by 
    solving the POTD on the ith day, where 1 <= coins[i] <= 2024 
    and the sum of coins <= 2024.

    All the doors are closed initially. 
    
    You move to and fro in the alley changing the states of the doors as follows: 
    
    you open a door that is already closed and you close a door that is already opened. 
    
    You start at one end go on altering the state of the doors till 
    you reach the other end and then you come back and start altering the states of the doors      again.
    
    In the first go, you alter the states of doors numbered 1, 2, 3, , n.
    
    In the second go, you alter the states of doors numbered 2, 4, 6
    
    In the third go, you alter the states of doors numbered 3, 6, 9
    
    You continue this till the Nth go in which 
    you alter the state of the door numbered N.
    
    You have to find the number of open doors

    Given an expression string x.
     
    Examine whether the pairs and the 
    orders of {,},(,),[,] are correct in exp.
    
    For example, the function should 
    return 'true' for exp = [()]{}{[()()]()} 
    and 'false' for exp = [(]).
    
    Note: The drive code prints "balanced" 
    if function return true, otherwise it prints "not balanced".

    Given an array of integers arr[] of length N, 
    every element appears thrice except for one which occurs once.
    Find that element which occurs once.

  Q2: Peak element:

    An element is called a peak element if its value 
    is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements (if they exists). 
    
    Given an array arr[] of size N, 
    Return the index of any one of its peak elements. 
    
    Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index 
    that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0. 
    
    Also, arr[] will be in ascending order before the peak element, 
    and in descending order after that.

  Q3: Common elements:

    Given three arrays sorted in increasing order. 
    Find the elements that are common in all three arrays.

Day 33:

  Q1: Count possible ways to construct buildings:

    There is a road passing through a city with N plots on both sides of the road. 
    Plots are arranged in a straight line on either side of the road. 
    Determine the total number of ways to construct buildings in these plots, 
    ensuring that no two buildings are adjacent to each other. Specifically, 
    buildings on opposite sides of the road cannot be adjacent.
    
    Using * to represent a plot and || for the road, 
    the arrangement for N = 3 can be visualized as follows: * * * || * * *.
    
    Note: As the answer can be very large, print it mod 10^9+7.

  Q2: Find triplets with zero sum:

    Given an array arr[] of n integers. 
    Check whether it contains a triplet that sums up to zero. 
    
    Note: Return 1, if there is at least 
    one triplet following the condition else return 0.

Day 34:

  Q1: Techfest and the Queue:
    
    A Techfest is underway, and each participant 
    is given a ticket with a unique number. Organizers 
    decide to award prize points to everyone 
    who has a ticket ID between a and b (inclusive). 
    
    The points given to a participant with 
    ticket number x will be the sum of powers of the prime factors of x.
    
    For instance, if points are to be awarded 
    to a participant with ticket number 12, 
    the amount of points given out will be 
    equal to the sum of powers in the prime factorization 
    of 12 (2^2 Ã— 3^1), which will be 2 + 1 = 3.
    
    Given a and b, determine the sum of all the points 
    that will be awarded to the participants with ticket 
    numbers between a and b (inclusive).

  Q2: Majority Element:

    Given an array A of N elements. 
    Find the majority element in the array. 
    A majority element in an array A of size N 
    is an element that appears strictly more 
    than N/2 times in the array.

  Q3: Minimum Platforms:

    Given arrival and departure times of all trains 
    that reach a railway station. 
    
    Find the minimum number of platforms required 
    for the railway station so that no train is kept waiting.
    
    Consider that all the trains arrive on the 
    same day and leave on the same day. Arrival and 
    departure time can never be the same for a train 
    but we can have arrival time of one train equal 
    to departure time of the other. 
    
    At any given instance of time, same platform 
    can not be used for both departure of a train 
    and arrival of another train. In such cases, 
    we need different platforms.


Day 35:

  Q1: Split Array Largest Sum:

    Given an array arr[] of N elements and a number K., 
    split the given array into K subarrays such that the 
    maximum subarray sum achievable out of K subarrays 
    formed is minimum possible. 
    Find that possible subarray sum.

  Q2: Power of Numbers:

    Given a number and its reverse. 
    Find that number raised to the power of its own reverse.
    
    Note: As answers can be very large, 
    print the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

  Q3: The Celebrity Problem:

    A celebrity is a person who is known to all but 
    does not know anyone at a party. 
    
    If you go to a party of N people, 
    find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
    
    A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people 
    at the party such that if an element of row i and column j  
    is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. 
    
    Here M[i][i] will always be 0.
    
    Note: Follow 0 based indexing.
