    NOTE:
    
    Each multiplication is denoted by putting open & closed brackets 
    to the matrices multiplied & also Please note that the order of 
    matrix multiplication matters, as matrix multiplication is non-commutative A*B != B*A
    
    As there can be multiple possible answers, 
    the console would print "True" for the correct string 
    and "False" for the incorrect string. 
    You need to only return a string that performs

  Q1: Find all critical connections in the graph:

    A critical connection refers to an edge that, 
    upon removal, will make it impossible for certain nodes 
    to reach each other through any path. You are given an 
    undirected connected graph with v vertices and 
    e edges and each vertex distinct and ranges from 0 to v-1, 
    and you have to find all critical connections in the graph. 
    It is ensured that there is at least one such edge present.
    
    Note: The answers may be presented in various potential orders. 
    Each edge should be displayed in sorted order. For instance, 
    if there's an edge between node 1 and node 2, 
    it should be stored as (1,2) rather than (2,1). 
    
    Additionally, it is expected that you 
    store the edges in sorted order.

    and the right child points to the next element in the 
    sorted list of elements of the BST (look at the examples for clarity). 
    
    You must accomplish this without using any extra storage, 
    except for recursive calls, which are allowed.
    
    Note: If your BST does have a left child, 
    then the system will print a -1 and will skip it, 
    resulting in an incorrect solution.

    And you can do the following operation any 
    number of times until the array becomes beautiful.
    
    If two adjacent integers are different i.e. 
    one of them is negative and other is non-negative, 
    remove them.
    
    Return the beautiful array after 
    performing the above operation.
    
    Note:An empty array is also a beautiful array. 
    There can be many adjacent integers which are 
    different as stated above. 
    
    So remove different adjacent integers 
    as described above from left to right.

    For example, the number 190 will be 
    represented by the linked list, 1->9->0->null, 
    similarly 25 by 2->5->null. Sum of these two numbers 
    is 190 + 25 = 215, which will be represented 
    by 2->1->5->null. 
    
    You are required to return the 
    head of the linked list 2->1->5->null.
    
    Note: There can be leading zeros in the input lists,

    serialize() : stores the tree into an array a and returns the array.
    
    deSerialize() : deserializes the array to the tree 
    and returns the root of the tree.
    
    Note: Multiple nodes can have the same data 
    and the node values are always positive integers. 
    
    Your code will be correct if the tree returned 
    by deSerialize(serialize(input_tree)) 
    is same as the input tree. 
    
    Driver code will print the in-order 
    traversal of the tree returned by

    Inversion Count: For an array, 
    inversion count indicates how far (or close) 
    the array is from being sorted. 
    
    If the array is already sorted 
    then the inversion count is 0.
    
    If an array is sorted in the reverse order 
    then the inversion count is the maximum.

    You need to return a list of integers containing 
    all the nodes that don't have a 
    sibling in sorted order (Increasing).
    
    Two nodes are said to be siblings 
    if they are present at the same level, 
    and their parents are the same.
    
    Note: The root node can not have a sibling 
    so it cannot be included in our answer.

  Q2: Bottom View of Binary Tree:

    Given a binary tree, 
    print the bottom view from left to right.
    
    A node is included in bottom view 
    if it can be seen when we look at 
    the tree from bottom.
    
    
                          20
                        /    \
                      8       22
                    /   \        \

                        /   \      
                      10    14
    
    For the above tree, the bottom view is 5 10 3 14 25.
    
    If there are multiple bottom-most nodes 
    for a horizontal distance from root, 
    then print the later one in level traversal. 
    
    For example, in the below diagram, 3 and 4 
    are both the bottommost nodes at 
    horizontal distance 0, we need to print 4.
    
                          20
                        /    \
                      8       22
                    /   \     /   \
                  5      3 4     25
                         /    \      
                     10       14
    
    For the above tree the output should be 5 10 4 14 25.
    
    Note: The Input/Output format and 
    Example given are used for the system's 
    internal purpose, and should be used 
    by a user for Expected Output only. 
    
    As it is a function problem, 
    hence a user should not read 
    any input from the stdin/console. 
    
    The task is to complete the function specified, 
    and not to write the full code.

  Q3: Validate an IP Address:

    Write a program to Validate an IPv4 Address.
    
    According to Wikipedia, IPv4 addresses 
    are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, 
    which consists of four decimal numbers, 
    each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, 
    e.g., 172.16.254.1 .
    
    A valid IPv4 Address is of the form x1.x2.x3.x4 
    where 0 <= (x1, x2, x3, x4) <= 255.
    
    Thus, we can write the generalized form 
    of an IPv4 address as (0-255).(0-255).(0-255).(0-255).
    
    Note: Here we are considering numbers only 
    from 0 to 255 and any additional leading 
    zeroes will be considered invalid.
    
    Your task is to complete the function isValid 
    which returns 1 if the given IPv4 address is 
    valid else returns 0. The function takes the 
    IPv4 address as the only argument in the form of string.

    We earn the profit associated with job 
    if and only if the job is completed by its deadline.
    
    Find the number of jobs done and the maximum profit.
    
    Note: Jobs will be given in the form (Jobid, Deadline, Profit) 
    associated with that Job. 
    
    Deadline of the job is the time before 
    which job needs to be completed to earn the profit.

    assuming both players play optimally.

  Q2: Stock Span Problem:

    The stock span problem is a financial problem 
    where we have a series of n daily price quotes 
    for a stock and we need to calculate the 
    span of stocks price for all n days. 
    
    The span Si of the stocks price on a given day i 
    is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days 
    just before the given day, for which the price of 
    the stock on the given day is less than or equal to 
    its price on the current day.
    
    For example, if an array of 7 days prices is given 
    as {100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85}, then the span values 
    for corresponding 7 days are {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6}.
