Given two integers ‘n’ and ‘sum’, 
find the count of all n digit numbers 
whose sum of digits is ‘sum’. 

Leading 0’s are not counted as digits. 

Since the answer can be large, 
output it modulo 10^9+7.


Example 1:

Input: n = 2, sum = 2

Output: 2

Explaination: 
The 2 digit numbers are 11 and 20.


Example 2:

Input: n = 1, sum = 10

Output: -1

Explaination: 
We cannot get sum as 10 from a single digit.


Your Task:

You do not need to read 
input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the 
function countWays() which 
takes the value n and sum as 
input parameters and returns 
the number of possible ways 
modulo 10^9+7. 

If there is no possible way 
then it returns -1.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n*sum)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n*sum)


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ sum ≤ 10^3
