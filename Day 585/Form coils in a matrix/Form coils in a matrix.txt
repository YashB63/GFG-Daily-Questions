Given a positive integer n that represents 
dimensions of a 4n x 4n matrix with values 
from 1 to 4*n*4*n filled from left to right 
and top to bottom. 

Your task is to form two coils 
from matrix and print the coils.

Follow the given examples for 
better understanding.

 
Example 1:

Input:
n = 1

Output:
10 6 2 3 4 8 12 16
7 11 15 14 13 9 5 1 

Explanation:
The matrix is 
1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9  10 11 12
13 14 15 16
So, the two coils are as given in the Ouput.


Example 2:

Input:
n = 2

Output:
36 28 20 21 22 30 38 46
54 53 52 51 50 42 34 26
18 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
16 24 32 40 48 56 64

29 37 45 44 43 35 27 19
11 12 13 14 15 23 31 39
47 55 63 62 61 60 59 58
57 49 41 33 25 17 9 1 
 
Explanation:


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function formCoils() 
which takes an Integer n as input and returns a 
vector of two vectors representing coil1 and coil2.

 
Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n^2)

 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 20
