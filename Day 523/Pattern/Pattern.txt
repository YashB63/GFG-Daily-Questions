Geek is very fond of patterns. 

Once, his teacher gave him a 
star pattern to solve. 

He gave Geek an integer n and 
asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a star pattern.


Example 1:


Example 2:


Your Task:

You don't need to input anything. 

Complete the function printDiamond() 
which takes an integer n  as the 
input parameter and prints the pattern.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N^2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1<= n <= 100
