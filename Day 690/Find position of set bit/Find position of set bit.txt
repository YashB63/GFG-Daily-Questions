Given a number n having only one ‘1’ and all other ’0’s 
in its binary representation, find the position of the 
only set bit. 

If there are 0 or more than 1 set bit the answer should be -1. 

The position of set bit '1' should be counted starting with 1 
from the LSB side in the binary representation of the number.


Examples:

Input: n = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: 2 is represented as "10" in Binary. 

As we see there's only one set bit and it's in position 2.


Input: n = 5

Output: -1

Explanation: 5 is represented as "101" in Binary. 

As we see there's two set bits and thus the output -1.


Constraints:
0 <= n <= 10^8
