Given two integers a and b, 
the task is to convert the 
fraction a/b into decimal format. 

If the fractional part is repeating,
enclose the repeating part in parentheses.


Examples:

Input: a = 1, b = 2

Output: "0.5"

Explanation: 1/3 = 0.5 with no repeating part.


Input: a = 50, b = 22

Output: "2.(27)"

Explanation: 50/22 = 2.27272727.. 

Since fractional part (27) is repeating, 
it is enclosed in paranthesis.


Constraints:

1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2000
