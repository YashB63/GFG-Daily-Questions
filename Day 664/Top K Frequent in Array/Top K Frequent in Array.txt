Given a non-empty integer array arr[]. 

Your task is to find and return the top k 
elements which have the highest frequency 
in the array.

Note: If two numbers have the same frequency, 
the larger number should be given the higher 
priority.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1], 
k = 2

Output: [4, 1]

Explanation: Frequency of 4 is 2 and frequency of 1 
is 2, these two have the maximum frequency and 4 is 
larger than 1.


Input: arr[] = [7, 10, 11, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 11, 8, 9], 
k = 4

Output: [5, 11, 7, 10]

Explanation: Frequency of 5 is 3, frequency of 11 
is 2, frequency of 7 is 2, frequency of 10 is 1.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ k ≤ no. of distinct elements
