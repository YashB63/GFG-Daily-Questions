Given an array arr[] of positive integers, 
you need to select all integers from the array 
in an order that maximizes the total points. 

For each selected integer, the points earned 
are equal to the integer's value multiplied 
by the number of integers already selected 
before it. 

Calculate the maximum points possible 
and return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 4, 9]

Output: 54

Explanation:
Select 1: Points = 1 * 0 = 0
Select 2: Points = 2 * 1 = 2
Select 2: Points = 2 * 2 = 4
Select 4: Points = 4 * 3 = 12
Select 9: Points = 9 * 4 = 36
Total Points: 0 + 2 + 4 + 12 + 36 = 54.


Input: arr[] = [2, 2, 2, 2] 

Output: 12 


Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints :

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
