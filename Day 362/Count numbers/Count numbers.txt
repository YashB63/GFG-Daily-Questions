Given a number N, count the numbers from 1 to N that 
don’t contain digit 3 in their decimal representation.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5

Output:
4

Explanation:
From 1 - 5, only 3 contains
3 in its decimal representation
so output is 4


Example 2:

Input:
N = 25

Output:
22

Explanation:
In between 1 to 25,
3,13,23 contain 3 in their
decimal representaion so 
output is 25 - 3 = 22


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function count() 
which takes an integer N as input parameter 
and returns an integer, the total count of 
numbers from 1 to N that don’t contain digit 
3 in their decimal representation.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:

0 <= N <= 500
