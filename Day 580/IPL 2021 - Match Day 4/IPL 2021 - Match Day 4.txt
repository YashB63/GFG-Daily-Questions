Due to the rise of covid-19 cases in India, 
this year BCCI decided to organize knock-out 
matches in IPL rather than a league.

Today is matchday 4 and it is between 
one-time champions Rajasthan Royals 
and the team lead by the Youngest 
Captian - Delhi Capitals. 

As this match is very crucial, Rahul Tewatia, 
Rajasthan Royals all-rounder wants to hit 
six sixes in an over.  

But he knows that he can only hit six sixes 
if he finds the maximum AND value that can 
be generated by any pair of elements from 
the given array. 

Help Tewatia to find the answer.

Note: AND is a bitwise '&' operator.


Example 1:

Input: 
N = 4
arr[] = {4, 8, 12, 16}

Output: 8

Explanation:
Pair (8, 12) has the Maximum AND Value 8.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {4, 8, 16, 2}

Output: 0

Explanation: Maximum AND Value is 0.


Your Task: 

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function maxAND() 
which takes the array elements and N 
(size of the array) as input parameters and 
returns the maximum AND value generated by any 
pair in the array.


Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
