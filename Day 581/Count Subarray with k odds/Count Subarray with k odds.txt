You are given array nums of n elements 
and integer k, count the number of 
subarrays that has k odd numbers.


Example1:

Input:
n = 5
nums = [1,1,2,1,1]
k = 3

Output:
2

Explanation:
There are 2 subarrays with k 
odds [1,1,2,1] and [1,2,1,1]


Example 2:

Input:
n=3
nums = [2,4,6]
k = 1

Output:
0


Your Task:

You don't have to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
countSubarray() which takes the integer 
n and array nums and integer k as input 
and returns the count of subarray having 
k odds number.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)


Constraint:

1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= nums <= 10^9
1 <= k <=n
