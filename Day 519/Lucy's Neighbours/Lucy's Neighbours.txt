Lucy lives in house number x. 

She has a list of n house 
numbers in the society. 

Distance between houses can be 
determined by studying the 
difference between house numbers. 

Help her find out k closest neighbors. 

Return the list of house 
numbers in sorted order.

Note: If two houses are equidistant and 
Lucy has to pick only one, the house 
with the smaller house number is given 
preference.


Examples :

Input: n = 5, x = 0, k = 4, arr[] = [-21, 21, 4, -12, 20] 

Output: -21 -12 4 20

Explanation: The closest neighbour is house number 4. 

Followed by -12 and 20. 

-21 and 21 are both equal distance from X=0. 

Therefore, Lucy can only pick 1. 

Based on the given condition she picks 
-21 as it is the smaller of the two. 


Input: n = 6, x = 5, k = 3, 
arr[] = [10, 2, 14, 4, 7, 6]

Output: 4 6 7 


Expected Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:

1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5 
-10^4 ≤ x, arr[i] ≤ 10^4
