Given an unsorted array arr[] of numbers, 
sort the array in ascending order.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 3, 2]

Output: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Explanation: After sorting, array 
will be like [1, 2, 3, 5].


Input: arr[] = [3, 1]

Output: [1, 3]

Explanation: After sorting, array 
will be like [1, 3].


Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]

Output: [1, 2, 3]

Explanation: It's already sorted 
in ascending order.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
