Given a string s of lowercase alphabets. 

The task is to find the maximum occurring 
character in the string s. 

If more than one character occurs the maximum 
number of times then print the 
lexicographically smaller character.


Examples:

Input: s = "testsample"

Output: 'e'

Explanation: 'e' is the character which 
is having the highest frequency.


Input: s = "output"

Output: 't'

Explanation: 't' and 'u' are the characters 
with the same frequency, but 't' is 
lexicographically smaller.


Constraints:
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100
