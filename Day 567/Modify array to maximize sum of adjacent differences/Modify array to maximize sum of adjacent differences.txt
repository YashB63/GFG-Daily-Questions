Given an array arr of size N, the task is to 
modify values of this array in such a way 
that the sum of absolute differences between 
two consecutive elements is maximized. 

If the value of an array element is X, 
then we can change it to either 1 or X. 

Find the maximum possible value of the 
sum of absolute differences between two 
consecutive elements.


Example 1:

Input: N = 4, arr[] = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]

Output: 8

Explanation: We can modify above array as
arr[] = [3, 1, 1, 4, 1]
Sum of differences = 
|1-3| + |1-1| + |4-1| + |1-4| = 8
Which is the maximum obtainable value 
among all choices of modification.


Example 2:

Input: N = 2, arr[] = {1, 5}

Output: 4

Explanation: No modification required


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function maximumDifferenceSum() 
which takes N and array arr as input 
parameters and returns the integer value


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
