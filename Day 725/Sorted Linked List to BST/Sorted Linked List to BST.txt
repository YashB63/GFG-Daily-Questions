Given a Singly Linked List which has data members 
sorted in ascending order. 

Construct a Balanced Binary Search Tree which 
has same data members as the given Linked List.

Note: There might be nodes with the same value.


Examples:

Input: Linked List: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7

Output: 4 2 1 3 6 5 7

Explanation : The BST formed using elements of the linked list is -
        4
      /   \
     2     6
   /  \   / \
  1   3  5   7  
Hence, preorder traversal of this tree is 4 2 1 3 6 5 7


Input: Linked List : 1->2->3->4
 
Ouput: 3 2 1 4

Explanation: The BST formed using elements of the linked list is -

Hence, the preorder traversal of this tree is 3 2 1 4


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)
 

Constraints:

1 ≤ Number of Nodes ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ Value of each node ≤ 10^6
