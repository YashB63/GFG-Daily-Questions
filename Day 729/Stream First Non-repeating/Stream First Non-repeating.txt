Given a string s consisting of only lowercase alphabets, 
for each index i in the string (0 ≤ i < n), find the 
first non-repeating character in the prefix s[0..i]. 

If no such character exists, use '#'.


Examples:

Input: s = "aabc"

Output: a#bb

Explanation: 
At i=0 ("a"): First non-repeating character is 'a'.
At i=1 ("aa"): No non-repeating character, so '#'.
At i=2 ("aab"): First non-repeating character is 'b'.
At i=3 ("aabc"): Non-repeating characters are 
'b' and 'c'; 'b' appeared first, so 'b'. 


Input: s = "bb" 

Output: "b#" 

Explanation: 
At i=0 ("b"): First non-repeating character is 'b'.
At i=1 ("bb"): No non-repeating character, so '#'.


Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10^5
