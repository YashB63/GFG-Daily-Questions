Given an array arr[]. 

Your task is to return an integer denoting 
the total number of times digit k appears 
in the array.


Examples:

Input: k=1, arr[] = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

Output: 6 

Explanation: Here, digit 1 appears 
in the whole array 6 times.


Input: k=3, arr[] = [11, 121, 15]

Output: 0 

Explanation: Here, digit 3 appears 
in the whole array 0 times.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1<=arr.size()<=20
1<=arr[i]<=1000
1<=k<=9
