You are now familiar with the dictionary in Python. 

It's time to dive deeper into the dictionary in Python. 

How can you use a dictionary to store 
the frequency of elements in list L. 

Given below is one method:

for i in L:
     dict[i] = 0

for i in L:
     dict[i] += 1
Now, use this concept to solve a question. 

Given a list arr, of N positive integers, and a sum. 

The task is to check if any pair exists in the 
array whose sum is equal to the given sum.


Example:

Input: 
N = 7 
sum = 8 
arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5] 

Output: 
Yes

Explanation:
Pair with sum 8 is present in
the array which is (5, 3).


Your Task:

Your task is to complete the function pair_sum() 
which returns True if the required pair is present, 
else return False. 

Driver code will take care of the printing.


Constraints:
1 <= N, sum <= 10^4
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
