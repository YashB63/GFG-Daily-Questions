Given a single sentence s, 
check if it is a palindrome or not. 
Ignore white spaces and any other character you may encounter. 


Example 1:

Input:
s = race car.
Output: 1 
Explanation: processing str gives us
"racecar" which is a palindrome.


Example 2:

Input:
s = hello world.
Output: 0
Explanation: processing str gives us
"helloworld" which is not a palindrome.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. 
Complete the function sentencePalindrome() 
which takes a string s as input parameter 
and returns a boolean value denoting if 
sentence is a palindrome or not.

Note: The driver code prints 1 if the returned value is true, otherwise 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N) where N is length of s.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1<= s.length() <= 10^4
All the alphabets used in the sentence are in lower case.
