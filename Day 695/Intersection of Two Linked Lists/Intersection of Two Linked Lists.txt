Given two linked lists head1 and head2, find the 
intersection of two linked lists. 

Each of the two linked lists contains distinct node values.

Note: The order of nodes in this list should be the same 
as the order in which those particular nodes appear in 
input head1 and return null if no common element is present.


Examples:

Input: LinkedList1: 9->6->4->2->3->8 , LinkedList2: 1->2->8->6
 
Output: 6->2->8

Explanation: Nodes 6, 2 and 8 are common in both of the 
lists and the order will be according to LinkedList1. 


Input: LinkedList1: 5->3->1->13->14 , LinkedList2: 3->13
 
Output: 3->13

Explanation: Nodes 3 and 13 are common in both 
of the lists and the order will be according to 
LinkedList1. 


Expected time complexity: O(m+n)
Expected auxiliary space: O(m+n)


Constraints:

1 <= no. of nodes in head1, head2 <= 10^4
1 <= node->data <= 10^5
