Given a positive integer x. 

Your task is to check, if it is even or odd 
(Any number that gives zero as remainder when 
divided by 2 is an even number)


Examples

Input: x = 4

Output: Even


Input: x = 5

which returns True (In python, True starts with caps T) 
if the number is even, else return False (In Python, 
False starts with caps F).

Note: Python functions, just like variables, 
don't have a datatype keyword preceding the 
identifier.


Constraints:
1 <= x <= 10^6
