Given an integer N, find its factorial.
 
Return a list of integers denoting the 
digits that make up the factorial of N.


Example 1:

Input: N = 5

Output: [1,2,0]

Explanation : 5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120


Example 2:

Input: N = 10

Output: [3,6,2,8,8,0,0]

Explanation :
10! = 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10 = 3628800


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function factorial() that takes 
integer N as input parameter and returns a list 
of integers denoting the digits that make up 
the factorial of N.


Expected Time Complexity : O(N^2)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
