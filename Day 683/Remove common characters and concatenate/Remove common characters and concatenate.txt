Given two strings, s1 and s2. 

The task is to remove all characters that are common in both 
strings and then combine the remaining characters from each 
string to form a new string. 

The characters that are not shared between the two strings 
should appear in the result in the same order as they appear 
in their respective original strings. 

If, after removing the common characters, no characters 
are left to form the result, return "-1"


Examples:

Input: s1 = aacdb, s2 = gafd

Output: cbgf

Explanation: The common characters of s1 and s2 are: a, d. 

The uncommon characters of s1 and s2 are c, b, g and f. 

Thus the modified string with uncommon characters 
concatenated is cbgf.


Input: s1 = abcs, s2 = cxzca

Output: bsxz

Explanation: The common characters of s1 and s2 are: a,c. 

The uncommon characters of s1 and s2 are b,s,x and z. 

Thus the modified string with uncommon characters 
concatenated is bsxz.


Constraints: 
1 <= |Length of Strings| <= 10^5
