Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.


Examples:

Input: root = [1, 3, 2, 4]

Output: 2

Explanation: Minimum depth is between nodes 1 and 2 
since minimum depth is defined as the number of 
nodes along the shortest path from the root node down 
to the nearest leaf node.


Input: root = [10, 20, 30, N, 40, N, 60, N, N, 2]
 
Output: 3 

Explanation: Minimum depth is between nodes 10,20 and 40. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(height of the tree)


Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5
