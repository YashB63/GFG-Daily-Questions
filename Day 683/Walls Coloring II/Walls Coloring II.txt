You are given n walls arranged in a row, 
and each wall must be painted using one 
of the k available colors. 

The cost of painting ith wall with jth color 
is given by costs[i][j]. 

Your task is to determine the minimum total cost 
required to paint all the walls in such a way 
that no two adjacent walls share the same color. 

If it is impossible to paint the walls under 
this condition, you must return -1.


Examples:

Input: n = 4, k = 3,
costs[][] = [[1, 5, 7],
           [5, 8, 4],
           [3, 2, 9],
           [1, 2, 4]]

Output: 8

Explanation:
Paint wall 0 with color 0. Cost = 1
Paint wall 1 with color 2. Cost = 4
Paint wall 2 with color 1. Cost = 2
Paint wall 3 with color 0. Cost = 1
Total Cost = 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 8


Input: n = 5, k = 1,
costs[][] = [[5],
           [4],
           [9],
           [2],
           [1]]

Output: -1

Explanation: It is not possible to color 
all the walls under the given conditions.


Constraints:

0 ≤ n  ≤ 10^3
0 ≤ k  ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ costs[i][j] ≤ 10^5
