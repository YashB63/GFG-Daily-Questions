Given a binary tree and the task is to 
find the spiral order traversal of the 
tree and return the list containing the 
elements.

Spiral order Traversal mean: Starting 
from level 0 for root node, for all 
the even levels we print the node's 
value from right to left and for all 
the odd levels we print the node's 
value from left to right.

For below tree, function should 
return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

 
Examples:

Input: root = [1, 3, 2]
 
Output: [1, 3, 2]

Explanation: Start with root (1), 
print level 0 (right to left), 
then level 1 (left to right).


Input: root = [10, 20, 30, 40, 60]

Output: [10, 20, 30, 60, 40]

Explanation: Start with root (10), 
print level 0 (right to left), 
level 1 (left to right), and continue 
alternating.


Input: root = [1, 2, N, 4]
  
Output: [1, 2, 4]

Explanation: Start with root (1), 
then level 1 (left to right), then 
level 2 (right to left).


Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes <= 10^5
0 <= node->data <= 10^5
