2 players A and B take turns alternatively 
to play a game in which they have N numbers 
on a paper. 

In one turn, a player can replace one 
of the numbers by any of its factor 
(except for 1 & the number itself). 

The player who is unable to make 
a move looses the game. 

Find the winner of the game if A starts 
the game and both play optimally.
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5, 7, 3]

Output: B

Explanation: Since all the numbers are prime,
so A will not be able to make the first move. 


Example 2:

Input: nums = [2, 4, 7, 11]

Outptut: A

Explanation: In the first move A will replace 4
by 2, so the numbers will become [2, 2, 7, 11]
now B will not be able to make a move since all 
the remaining numbers can only be divided by 1 
or the number itself.  


Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function brainGame() 
which takes the list of numbers as input parameter 
and returns true if A wins and false if B wins.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N^2)
Expected Space Complexity: O(N)
 

Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
