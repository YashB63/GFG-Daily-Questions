Convert a given string to its cross string 
(i.e Diagonal from left-right and from right-left). 

See examples for better understanding.


Example 1:

Input:
abc
Output:
a c  b  a c

Explanation:
The above is the proper 
cross manner for the 
test case.

a c
 b 
a c


Example 2:

Input:
geeks
Output:
g   s e k   e   e k g   s
Explanation:
For the 1st test case where 
the string is geeks

G   S
 E K
  E
 E K
G   S

The above is the proper cross 
the manner for the test case, but 
when printed in a single line 
it becomes as shown in the output.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function crossPattern() 
which takes the string S and returns a single string 
in the following way first-line output of the string 
concatenated with 2nd line and so on till the Nth line.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:

1 ≤ length of string ≤ 1000
