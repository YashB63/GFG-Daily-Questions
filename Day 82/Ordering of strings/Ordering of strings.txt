You will be given N number of strings. 
You have to find the lexicographically smallest string 
and the lexicographically largest string among these strings.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
strings = a , ab , abc
Output: a abc
Explanation: Lexicographically smallest is
"a" and lexicographically largest is
"abc".
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
strings = abc , abc
Output: abc abc
Explanation: Lexicographically smallest is
"abc" and lexicographically largest is
"abc"
 

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. 
Complete the function orderStringâ€‹() 
which takes a 2d character array and an integer N 
as input parameter and returns an array of size 2 
where first value should be lexicographically 
smallest string and second value should be 
lexicographically largest string.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N* max of all string length ).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
 

Constraints:
1 <= N , length of each string <= 10^3
