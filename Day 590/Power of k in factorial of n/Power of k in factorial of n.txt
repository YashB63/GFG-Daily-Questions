Given two positive integers n and k, 
determine the highest value of x such 
that kx divides n! (n factorial) 
completely (i.e., n % (kx) == 0).


Examples :

Input: n = 7, k = 2

Output: 4

Explanation: 7! = 5040, and 24 = 16 is the 
highest power of 2 that divides 5040.


Input: n = 10, k = 9

Output: 2

Explanation: 10! = 3628800, and 9² = 81 is 
the highest power of 9 that divides 3628800.


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
2 ≤ k ≤ 10^5
