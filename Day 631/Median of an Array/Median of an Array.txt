Given an array arr[] of integers, 
calculate the median.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [90, 100, 78, 89, 67]

Output: 89

Explanation: After sorting the array 
middle element is the median 


Input: arr[] = [56, 67, 30, 79]

Output: 61.5

Explanation: In case of even number of elements, 
average of two middle elements is the median. 


Input: arr[] = [1, 2]

Output: 1.5

Explanation: The average of both 
elements will result in 1.5.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
