Given two positive integers a and b, 
find GCD of a and b.

Note: Don't use the inbuilt gcd function


Examples:

Input: a = 20, b = 28

Output: 4

Explanation: GCD of 20 and 28 is 4


Input: a = 60, b = 36

Output: 12

Explanation: GCD of 60 and 36 is 12


Constraints:
1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9
