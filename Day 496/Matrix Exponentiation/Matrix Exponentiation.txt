Given an equation of the form f(n) = f(n-1) + 
f(n-2) where f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1 , the task is 
to find the nth term of this sequence.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3

Output: 3

Explanation: f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3


Example 2:

Input: n = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2
 

Yout Task:

You don't need to read or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
FindNthTerm() which takes n as input 
parameter and returns nth term mod 10^9+7 .


Expected Time Complexity: O(log(n))
Expected Space Complexity: O(K) where K is constant.
 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^9
