Given an increasing sequence arr, 
we need to find the K-th smallest 
missing element, taking the first 
element of the array as the starting 
point in the increasing sequence. 

If there is no k-th missing element then output -1.


Example:

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 4, 5, 7] and k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation: k = 2, Missing numbers are 2 and 6. 
So 2nd missing number is 6.


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8] and k = 1

Output: 7

Explanation: k = 1, the first 
missing number in the array is 7.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1 ≤  arr.size() ≤ 10^6
0 ≤  k, arr[i] ≤ 10^5
