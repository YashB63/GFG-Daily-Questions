Given an incomplete Sudoku configuration in terms 
of a 9x9  2-D square matrix(mat[][]) the task to 
check if the current configuration is valid or 
not where a 0 represents an empty block.

Note: Current valid configuration does not 
ensure validity of the final solved sudoku. 


Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [
[3, 0, 6, 5, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0]
[5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1]
[0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0]
[9, 0, 0, 8, 6, 3, 0, 0, 5]
[0, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 0, 0]
[1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4]
[0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 6, 3, 0, 0]
]

Output: true

Explaination: It is possible to have aproper sudoku.
