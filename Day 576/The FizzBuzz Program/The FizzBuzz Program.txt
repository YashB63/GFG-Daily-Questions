You are given a number and you have 
to print your answer according to 
the following:

If the number is divisible by 3, 
you print "Fizz" (without quotes)

If the number is divisible by 5, 
you print "Buzz" (without quotes)

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, 
you print "FizzBuzz" (without quotes)

In any other case, you 
print the number itself

Note: You should add a newline character 
after print() statement.
