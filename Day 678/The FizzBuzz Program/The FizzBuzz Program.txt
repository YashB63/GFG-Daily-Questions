You are given a number a and you have to print 
your answer according to the following:

If the number is divisible by 3, you print "Fizz" (without quotes)

If the number is divisible by 5, you print "Buzz" (without quotes)

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, 
you print "FizzBuzz" (without quotes)

In any other case, you print the number itself

Note: You should add a new-line character after 
print statement.


Examples:

Input: a = 3

Output: Fizz

Explanation: Here, the number is divisible by 3, 
so Fizz is printed.


Input: a = 5

Output: Buzz

Explanation: Here the number is divisible by 5, 
so Buzz is printed.


Input: a = 15

Output: FizzBuzz

Explanation: Here, the number 15 is divisible 
by both 3 and 5, so FizzBuzz is printed.


Constraints:
