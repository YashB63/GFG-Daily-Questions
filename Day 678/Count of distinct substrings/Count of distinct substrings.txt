Given a string s consisting of lowercase 
English characters, determine the total 
number of distinct non-empty substrings 
present in the string. 

A substring is defined as a contiguous 
block of characters within the string.

Two substrings are considered distinct if 
their contents differ, even if they 
originate from different positions in the 
string.

Note: The empty substring is not counted.


Examples :

Input: s = "ababa"

Output: 9

Explanation: All distinct substrings of "ababa" are: 
"a", "b", "ab", "ba", "aba", "bab", "abab", "baba", 
"ababa".


Input: s = "aaa"

Output: 3

Explanation: The distinct substrings of "aaa" are: 
"a", "aa", "aaa".


Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 3000
