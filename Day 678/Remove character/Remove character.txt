Given two strings str1 and str2, remove those characters 
from the first string(str1) which are present in the 
second string(str2). 

Both the strings are different and contain only 
lowercase characters.

NOTE: Size of the first string is always greater than 
the size of the second string( |str1| > |str2|).
 

Example 1:

Input: str1 = "computer", str2= "cat"

Output: "ompuer"

Explanation: After removing characters
(c, a, t) from string1 we get "ompuer".


Example 2:

Input: str1 = "occurrence", str2 = "car"

Output: "ouene"

Explanation: After removing characters 
(c, a, r) from string1 we get "ouene".


Constraints:
1 <= |Str1| , |Str2| <= 50
