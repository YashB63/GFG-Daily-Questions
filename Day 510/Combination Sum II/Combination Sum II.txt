You are given a collection of numbers (candidates) 
and a target number (target), find all unique 
combinations in candidates where the candidate 
numbers sum to the target. 

Each number in candidates may only 
be used once in the combination.

Note: The solution set must not 
contain duplicate combinations.


Example:

Input:  candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8. 

Output:  [[1,1,6], [1,2,5], [1,7], [2,6]]. 

Explanation:  These are the unique combinations 
whose sum is equal to the target.


Your Task:

Complete the function vector> combinationSum2(), 
which takes a vector "candidates" and an integer 
target and returns a vector of vector consisting 
of all unique combinations whose sum is equal to 
the target.


Expected Time Complexity: O(2^n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).


Constraints:

1 <= candidates.length <= 100.
1 <= candidates[i] <= 50.
1 <= target <= 30.
