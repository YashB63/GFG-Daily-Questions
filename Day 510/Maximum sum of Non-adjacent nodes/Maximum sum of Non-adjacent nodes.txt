Given a binary tree with a value 
associated with each node. 

Your task is to select a subset of nodes 
such that the sum of their values is 
maximized, with the condition that no 
two selected nodes are directly connected 
that is, if a node is included in the subset, 
neither its parent nor its children can be 
included.


Examples:

Input: root[] = [11, 1, 2]

Output: 11

Explanation: The maximum sum is 
obtained by selecting the node 11.


Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, N, 5, 6]

Output: 16

Explanation: The maximum sum is obtained by 
selecting the nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6, which 
are not directly connected to each other. 

Their total sum is 16.  


Constraints:

1 ≤ no. of nodes in the tree ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ Node.val ≤ 10^5
