Given a string s, a partitioning of the string is 
a palindrome partitioning if every sub-string of 
the partition is a palindrome. 

Determine the fewest cuts needed for palindrome 
partitioning of the given string.


Examples:

Input: s = "geek" 

Output: 2 

Explanation: We need to make minimum 2 cuts, i.e., "g | ee | k".


Input: s = "aaaa" 

Output: 0

Explanation: The string is already a palindrome.


Input: s = "ababbbabbababa" 

Output: 3

Explanation: We need to make minimum 3 cuts, 
i.e., "aba | bb | babbab | aba".


Constraints:

1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^3
s contain lowercase letters only
