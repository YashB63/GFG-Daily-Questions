Geek is very fond of patterns. 

Once, his teacher gave him a pattern to solve. 

He gave Geek an integer n and asked him 
to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a pattern.


Example 1:

Input: 5

Output:
1
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5


Example 2:

Input: 3

Output:
1
1 2 
1 2 3 


Your Task:

You don't need to input anything. 

Complete the function printTriangle() 
which takes an integer n as the input 
parameter and prints the pattern.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1<= n <= 100
