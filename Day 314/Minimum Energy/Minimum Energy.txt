Given an array containing positive and negative numbers. 

The array represents checkpoints from one end to 
the other end of the street. 

Positive and negative values represent 
the amount of energy at that checkpoint. 

Positive numbers increase the energy 
and negative numbers decrease. 

Find the minimum initial energy required to 
cross the street so that the energy level 
never becomes 0 or less than 0.

Note:  The value of the minimum initial energy 
required will be 1 even if we cross the street 
successfully without losing energy to less than 
and equal to 0 at any checkpoint. 

The 1 is needed for the initial checkpoint.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, -10, 4, 4, 4]

Output: 7

Explanation: By having an initial energy of 7 
we can make sure that all the checkpoints are 
visited and the fuel never reaches 0 or less value.


Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 2, 6, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: We need at least 1 initial 
energy to reach first checkpoint


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
-10^3 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^3
