In a city, N water tanks are connected by 
pipeline(As a tree) where the ith tank has
a capacity cap[i]. 

The ith element of the given Edge array of 
length N-1 represents that there is a 
pipeline between Edge[i][0] and Edge[i][1] 
tank. 

Since people working at the city corporation 
are lazy they usually select one of the tank 
and pour complete amount of water into it,
 when the tank is filled, the excess water 
evenly flows to the connected tanks. 

The head of city corporation has instructed to 
pour minimum amount of water into the selected 
tank so that all other tank is filled. 

As the labours of the corporation are not 
intelligent enough to figure out the 
minimum amount of water required to fill 
all the tanks they have asked your help. 

Also Maximum amount of water available 
with city corporation is 10^18.

NOTE: If the tank if full, the water 
flows to all of its connected tanks 
except the tank from which the water 
had come to it. i.e, to all tanks 
except the source for that particular 
tank. 

If it has no option to flow the water is 
considered to be wasted. S is the source 
tank.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 4 and S = 1
Edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4]]
Cap = [1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: 5

Explanation:
Initially 5 unit of water is poured into 
tank 1. 2 unit of it flows to tank 2 and 
2 unit of it flows into tank 3. From 2 
unit of water in tank 2, 1 unit flows into 
tank 4 and 1 unit from tank 3 is wasted.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 3 and S = 2
Edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3]]
Cap = [1, 1, 1]
Output: 3


Your Task: 
 
You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
minimum_amount() which takes an integer 
N, an integer S, 2-d array Edges, and 
an array Cap of length N as input 
parameters and returns the minimum 
amount of water required to fill all 
the tanks. If it is not possible to 
fill all the tanks print -1.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N*log(S))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
1 ≤ s,u,v ≤ n
1 ≤ capacity of each tank ≤ 1000000007
