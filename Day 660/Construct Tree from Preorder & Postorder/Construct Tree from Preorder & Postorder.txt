Given two arrays pre[] and post[] that represent 
the preorder and postorder traversals of a full 
binary tree. 

Your task is to construct the binary tree and 
return its root.

Note:  Full Binary Tree is a binary tree where 
every node has either 0 or 2 children.

The preorder and postorder traversals contain 
unique values, and every value present in the 
preorder traversal is also found in the 
postorder traversal.


Examples:

Input: pre[] = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 3, 6, 7], 
post[] = [8, 9, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 1]

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Explanation: The tree will look like
   

Input: pre[] = [1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7] , 
post[] = [4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 1]

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Explanation: The tree will look like
   

Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ pre[i], post[i] ≤ 10^4
