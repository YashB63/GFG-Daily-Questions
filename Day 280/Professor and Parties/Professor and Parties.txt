A professor attended a party and classified it into 
two categories based on the colors of the robes. 

If all party members are wearing different colored robes, 
represented by positive integers in the array arr[], 
then it is a girl's only party. 

If there is at least one duplicate color, 
it is a boy's party. 

Determine the type of party by returning “true” 
if it’s a boy’s party, otherwise, return “false”.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]

Output: false

Explanation: All the colors are unique so it's a GIRLS party.


Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1]

Output: true

Explanation: There are two colors 1. So it's a BOYS party.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arri ≤ 10^9
