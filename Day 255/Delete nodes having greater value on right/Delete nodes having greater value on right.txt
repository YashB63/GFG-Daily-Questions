Given a singly linked list, remove all the nodes 
with any node on their right whose value is greater 
and return the head of the modified linked list. 
 
(Not just the immediate Right, but the entire List on the Right)


Examples:

Input:
LinkedList = 12->15->10->11->5->6->2->3

Output: 15 11 6 3

Explanation: Since, 12, 10, 5 and 2 are the elements which 
have greater elements on the following nodes. 

So, after deleting them, the linked list 
would like be 15, 11, 6, 3.


Input:
LinkedList = 10->20->30->40->50->60

Output: 60

Explanation: All the nodes except the last node 
has a greater value node on its right, 
so all the nodes except the last node 
must be removed.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ size of linked list ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ element of linked list ≤ 10^5
