Given an array arr[] of sorted and distinct positive integers. 

The task is to find the length of the longest 
arithmetic progression in a given array.

Note: A sequence seq is an arithmetic progression 
if seq[i + 1] - seq[i] are all the same value 
(for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1).


Examples:

Input:arr[] = [1, 7, 10, 13, 14, 19]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest arithmetic 
progression is [1, 7, 13, 19].


Input:arr[] = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

Output: 5

Explanation: The whole array is in AP.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n2)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1000
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4
