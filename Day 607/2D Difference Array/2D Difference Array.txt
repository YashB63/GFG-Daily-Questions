You are given a 2D integer matrix mat[][] 
of size n × m and a list of q operations 
opr[][]. 

Each operation is represented as an 
array [v, r1, c1, r2, c2], where:

v is the value to be added
(r1, c1) is the top-left cell of a submatrix
(r2, c2) is the bottom-right cell of the submatrix (inclusive)

For each of the q operations, add v to every element 
in the submatrix from (r1, c1) to (r2, c2). 

Return the final matrix after applying all operations.


Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3],  opr[][] = [[2, 0, 0, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 0, 2, 2]]
                [1, 1, 0],
                [4,-2, 2]]

Output: [[3, 4, 3],
        [2, 2, -1],
        [3, -3, 1]]

Constraint:

1 ≤ n×m, q ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ r1 ≤ r2 ≤ n - 1
0 ≤ c1 ≤ c2 ≤ m - 1
-10^4 ≤ mat[i][j], v ≤ 10^4
