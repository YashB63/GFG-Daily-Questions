Given a string s, check if it is possible to convert it 
into a string that is the repetition of a substring of length k. 
Conversion has to be done by following the steps mentioned below only once:

Select two indices i and j (zero-based indexing, i could be equal to j), 
such that i and j are divisible by k.

Select substrings of length k starting from indices i and j.

Replace substring starting at index i with 
substring starting at index j within the string.
Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
K = 2
S = "bdac"

Output: 1

Explanation: We can replace either
"bd" with "ac" or "ac" with "bd"


Example 2:

Input: 
N = 5
K = 2
S = "abcde"

Output: 0

Explanation: Since n % k != 0, it's not 
possible to convert s into a string which
is a concatanation of a substring with 
length k.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function kSubstrConcat() 
which takes a string s, its length n and an integer k as inputs 
and return 1 if convertion of the given string is possible, else 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).

Constraints:
2 <= k < n <= 10^5
