Given a non-negative number N. The task is to apply 
at most one swap operation on the number N 
so that the result is the smallest possible number.

Note: Input and Output should not contain leading zeros.


Example 1:

Input: N = "9625635"
Output: "2695635"
Explanation: Swapped the digits 9 and 2.


Example 2:

Input: N = "1205763"
Output: "1025763"
Explanation: Swapped the digits 0 and 2.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function smallestNumber() 
which takes the string as inputs and returns the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|N|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|N|)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |N| ≤ 10^5
