Given a large number (represented as string S)  
which has to divided by another number 
(represented as int data type D). 
The task is to find division of these numbers.


Example 1:

Input: S = "123456" , D = 36
Output: 3429
Explanation: simply S/D = 3429


Example 2:

Input: S = "91345243" , D = 67
Output: 1363361
Explanation: S/D = 1363361

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function longDivision() 
which accepts a string S and an integer divisor D 
as input parameter and returns a string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
