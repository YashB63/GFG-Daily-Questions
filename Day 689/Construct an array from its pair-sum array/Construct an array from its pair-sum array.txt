Given a pair-sum array arr[] construct the original array. 

A pair-sum array for an array is the array that contains 
sum of all pairs in ordered form, i.e., arr[0] is sum of 
res[0] and res[1], arr[1] is sum of res[0] and res[2] and 
so on.

Note: If the size of original array res[] is n, 
then the size of pair-sum array arr[] would be 
n * (n -1) /2. 

We may assume that the pair-sum array arr[] is 
appropriate in size.

Note that, if the original array is correct then 
the driver code will print true, else false;


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 5, 3]

Output: true

Explanation: A valid original array is [3, 1, 2], 
pairwise sums are (3 + 1), (3 + 2) and (1 + 2).


Input: arr[] = [3]

Output: true

Explanation: One of the valid 
original array is [1, 2].


Constraints: 

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
