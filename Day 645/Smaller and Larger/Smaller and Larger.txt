Given a sorted array arr and a value target, 
return an array of size 2. 

The first value is the number of elements 
less than or equal to the target, and the 
second value is the number of elements 
greater than or equal to the target.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], 
target = 0

Output: 0, 7

Explanation: There are no elements less or 
equal to 0 and 7 elements greater to 0.


Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 8, 12, 12, 12, 19], 
target = 12

Output: 6, 4

Explanation: There are 6 elements less 
or equal to 12 and 4 elements greater 
or equal to 12.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ arr[i], target≤ 10^6
