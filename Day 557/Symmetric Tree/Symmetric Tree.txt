Given the root of a binary tree, check 
whether it is symmetric, i.e., whether 
the tree is a mirror image of itself.

A binary tree is symmetric if the left 
subtree is a mirror reflection of the 
right subtree.


Examples:

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]
  
Output: True

Explanation: As the left and right 
half of the above tree is mirror 
image, tree is symmetric.


Input: root[] = [1, 2, 2, N, 3, N, 3]

Output: False

Explanation:  As the left and right half 
of the above tree is not the mirror image, 
tree is not symmetric. 


Constraints:
1  ≤ number of nodes ≤ 2000
