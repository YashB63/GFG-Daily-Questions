Given a Deque deq containing non-negative integers.

Complete below functions depending type of query as 
mentioned and provided to you (indexing starts from 0):

1. eraseAt(x): this function should remove the 
element from specified position x in deque.

2. eraseInRange(start, end): this function should 
remove the elements in range start (inclusive), 
end (exclusive) specified in the argument of the 
function.

Note: If start is equal to end then simply return.

3. eraseAll(): remove all the elements from the deque.


Examples:

Input: deq = [1 2 4 5 6], query = [1 2]

Output: 1 2 5 6 

Explanation: Here the query type is 1 and the 
position is 2. 

So we remove element at position 2. 

The element at position 2 is 1 2 4 5 6. 

So, we remove 4 and get 1 2 5 6.


Input: deq = [1 2 3 4], query = [2 1 3]

Output: 1 4 

Explanation: Here the query type is 2 and the 
range is [1, 3). 

So we need to delete 1 2 3 4. 

Remember that end is exclusive. 

So the updated dequeue is 1 4.


Input: deq = [1 2 3], query = [3]

Output: Empty

Explanation: Here the query is of type 3 
so we remove all the elements of dequeue.


Constraints:
1 ≤ deq.size() ≤ 10^5
