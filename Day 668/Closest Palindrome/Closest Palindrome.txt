Given a number num, our task is to find the closest 
Palindrome number whose absolute difference with 
the given number is minimal. 

If 2 Palindrome numbers have the same absolute 
difference as the given number, take the 
smaller one.
 

Example 1:

Input: num = 9

Output: 9

Explanation: 9 itself is a palindrome
number.


Example 2:

Input: num = 489

Output: 484

Explanation: closest palindrome numbers from
489 are 484 and 494. Absolute difference between
489 and 494 is equal to the absolute difference
between 484 and 489 but 484 is smaller than 494.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
closestPalindrome() which takes num as 
input parameter and returns the closest 
palindrome.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log10num)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= num <= 10^14
