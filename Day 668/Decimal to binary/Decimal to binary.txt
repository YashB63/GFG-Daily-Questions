Given a decimal number n, 
return its binary equivalent.


Examples :

Input: n = 12

Output: 1100

Explanation: The binary representation of 12 is 
"1100", since 12 = 1×2^3 + 1×2^2 + 0×2^1 + 0×2^0


Input: n = 33

Output: 100001

Explanation: The binary representation of 33 
is "100001", since 33 = 1×2^5 + 0×2^4 + 0×2^3 + 
0×2^2 + 0×2^1 + 1×2^0


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 2^31 - 1
