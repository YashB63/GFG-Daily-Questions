Given two numbers N1 and N2, the task is to 
swap the first digit of the first number with 
the last digit of the second number and last 
digit of the first number with the first digit 
of the second number.


Example 1:

Input:  N1 = "1234", N2 = "5678" 

Output: 8235 4671

Explanation: swap {1, 8} and {4, 5}


Example 2:

Input: N1 = "555", N2 = "55"

Output: 555 55

Explanation: swap {5, 5} and {5, 5}


User Task:

Your task is to complete the function swapDigits() 
which takes two strings as input and modifies 
given strings. 

You do not need to take any input or print anything.

Note: In java code, a custom class Str is used instead of 
String data type because String in java is passed by value.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
2 <= |N1|, |N2| <= 10^5
