Given a String S (in lowerCase only). 

Starting from letter 'a' which is the only source. 

for example:- "aaabcahd..." . 

Now you can only jump from one character to 
another in the form that a to b; b to c; 
c to d and so on. 

You have to find the maximum distance 
from source to destination. 

And if there is no place to jump on then print -1.

 
Example 1:

Input: aaabcb

Output: 6

Explanation: As 'a' will only jump to 'b' 
and the maximum distance will is 6.


Example 2:

Input: aabac

Output: 5

Explanation: As 'a' will only jump to 'b' 
and 'b' will jump to 'c' and distance 
is 5.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function maximum_distance() 
which takes the string S as input parameter and returns 
the maximum distance. 

If not possible to reach at destination then return -1.


Expected Time complexity: O(n)
Expected Space complexity: O(n)


Constraints:
1 <= size of string <= 1000
