Given the coordinates of the endpoints(p1,q1, and p2,q2) 
of the two line segments. 

Check if they intersect or not. 

If the Line segments intersect return 
true otherwise return false.

Note: Please check the intersection 
lies within the line segments.


Examples

Input: p1=(1,1), q1=(10,1), p2=(1,2), q2=(10,2)

Output: false

Explanation:The two line segments formed by p1-q1 and p2-q2 do not intersect.


Input: p1=(10,0), q1=(0,10), p2=(0,0), q2=(10,10)

Output: true

Explanation: The two line segments formed by p1-q1 and p2-q2 intersect.


Input: p1=(5,-2), q1=(13,2), p2=(2,-3), q2=(3,0)

Output: false

Explanation: The two line segments formed by 
p1-q1 and p2-q2 are intersecting beyond endpoints, 
so it is not considerable.
