Geek is learning about functions and 
calling a function with arguments. 

He learns that passing can take one of two forms: 
pass by value or pass by reference.

Geek wishes to add 1 and 2, respectively, to 
the parameter passed by value and reference. 

Help Geek in fulfilling his goal.


Example 1:

Input:
a = 1
b = 2

Output:
2 4

Explanation: 1 was passed by value whereas 
2 passed by reference.


Example 2:

Input:
a = 10
b = 20

Output: 11 22

Explanation: 10 was passed by value whereas 
20 passed by reference.


Constraints:
1 <= a,b <= 10^5


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function passedBy() 
which takes a and b as input parameters and 
returns array of two required integers.


Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
