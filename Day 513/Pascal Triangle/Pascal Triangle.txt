Given a positive integer n, return 
the nth row of pascal's triangle.

Pascal's triangle is a triangular array 
of the binomial coefficients formed by 
summing up the elements of previous row.


Examples:

Input: n = 4

Output: [1, 3, 3, 1]

Explanation: 4th row of pascal's 
triangle is [1, 3, 3, 1].


Input: n = 5

Output: [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]

Explanation: 5th row of pascal's 
triangle is [1, 4, 6, 4, 1].


Input: n = 1

Output: [1]

Explanation: 1st row of pascal's triangle is [1].


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 20
