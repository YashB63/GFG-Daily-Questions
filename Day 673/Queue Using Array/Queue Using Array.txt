Implement a Queue using an Array, where 
the size of the array, n is given.

The Queue must support the following operations:

(i) enqueue(x): Insert an element x at the rear of the queue.
(ii) dequeue(): Remove the element from the front of the queue.
(iii) getFront(): Return front element if not empty, else -1.
(iv) getRear(): Return rear element if not empty, else -1.
(v) isEmpty(): Return true if the queue is empty else return false.
(vi) isFull(): Return true if the queue is full else return false.

There will be a sequence of queries queries[][]. 

The queries are represented in numeric form:

1 x : Call enqueue(x)
2: Call dequeue()
3: Call getFront()
4: Call getRear()
5: Call isEmpty()
6: Call isFull()

You just have to implement the functions enqueue, 
dequeue, getFront, getRear, isEmpty and isFull 
and the driver code will handle the output.


Examples:

Input: n = 3, q = 7, queries[][] = [[1, 5], 
[1, 3], [1, 4], [3], [2], [5], [4]]

Output: [5, false, 4]

Explanation: Queries on queue are as follows:

enqueue(5): Insert 5 at the rear of the queue.
enqueue(3): Insert 3 at the rear of the queue.
enqueue(4): Insert 4 at the rear of the queue.
getFront(): Return the front element i.e 5.
dequeue(): Remove the front element 5 from the queue.
isEmpty(): Return false as the queue is not empty.
getRear(): Return the rear element i.e 4.


Input: n = 2, q = 4, queries[][] = [[4], [1, 3], [1, 7], [6]]

Output: [-1, true]

Explanation: Queries on queue are as follows:

getRear(): As the queue is empty return -1.

enqueue(3): Insert 3 at the rear of the queue.

enqueue(7): Insert 7 at the rear of the queue.

isFull(): Return true as the queue is 
full i.e containing 2 elements.


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ number of query ≤ 10^3
0 ≤ x ≤ 10^5
