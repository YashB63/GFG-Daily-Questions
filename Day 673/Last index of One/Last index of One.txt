Given a string s consisting of only '0's and 
'1's, find the last index of the '1' present.

Note: If '1' is not present, return "-1"


Examples:

Input: s = 00001

Output: 4

Explanation: Last index of 
1 in given string is 4.


Input: s = 0

Output: -1

Explanation: Since, 1 is not 
present, so output is -1.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxillary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= |s| <= 10^6
s = {0,1}
