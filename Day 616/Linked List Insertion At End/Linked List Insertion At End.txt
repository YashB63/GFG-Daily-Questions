You are given the head of a Singly Linked List 
and a value x, insert that value x at the end 
of the LinkedList and return the head of 
modified Linked List.


Examples :

Input: x = 6
       
Output: 1->2->3->4->5->6

Explanation: We can see that 6 is 
inserted at the end of the linkedlist.

       
Input: x = 1
       
Output: 4->5->1

Explanation: We can see that 1 is 
inserted at the end of the linkedlist.
        
Constraints:

0 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ node->data , x ≤ 10^3
