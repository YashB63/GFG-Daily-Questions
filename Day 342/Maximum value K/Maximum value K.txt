Given an array arr[] of positive integers, 
find the maximum value of k such that there 
are at least k elements in the array that are 
greater than or equal to k.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Output: 4

Explanation: 4 elements [4, 5, 6, 7]  
are greater than equal to 4.


Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: 2

Explanation: 3 elements [2, 3, 4] 
are greater than equal to 2.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^6
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
