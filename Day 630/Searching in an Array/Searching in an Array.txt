Given an integer k and array arr. 

Your task is to return the position of 
the first occurrence of k in the given 
array and if element k is not present 
in the array then return -1.

Note: 1-based indexing is followed here.


Examples:

Input: k = 16 , arr = [9, 7, 16, 16, 4]

Output: 3

Explanation: The value 16 is found in the given

Output: -1

Explanation: k = 98 isn't found in the given array.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size <= 10^6
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
1 <= k <= 10^6
