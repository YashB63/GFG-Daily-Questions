Given two strings s1 and s2. 

You have to check that s1 is 
a subsequence of s2 or not.

Note: A subsequence is a sequence 
that can be derived from another 
sequence by deleting some elements 
without changing the order of the 
remaining elements.


Examples:

Input: s1 = "AXY", s2 = "YADXCP"

Output: false

Explanation: s1 is not a subsequence 
of s2 as 'Y' appears before 'A'.


Input: s1 = "gksrek", s2 = "geeksforgeeks"

Output: true

Explanation: If we combine the bold character 
of "geeksforgeeks", it equals to s1. 

So s1 is a subsequence of s2. 


Constraints:
1 ≤ s1.size(), s2.size() ≤ 10^6
