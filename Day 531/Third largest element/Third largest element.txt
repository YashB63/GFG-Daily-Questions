Given an array, arr of positive integers. 

Find the third largest element in it. 

Return -1 if the third largest element 
is not found.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]

Output: 3

Explanation: The third largest element 
in the array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] is 3.


Input: arr[] = [10, 2]

Output: -1

Explanation: There are less than 
three elements in the array, so 
the third largest element cannot 
be determined.


Input: arr[] = [5, 5, 5]

Output: 5

Explanation: In the array [5, 5, 5], 
the third largest element can be 
considered 5, as there are no other 
distinct elements.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
