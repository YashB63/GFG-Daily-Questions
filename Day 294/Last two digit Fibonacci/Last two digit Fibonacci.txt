Given a number N. Find the last two 
digits of the Nth fibonacci number.

Note: If the last two digits are 02, return 2.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 13

Output:
33

Explanation:
The 13th Fibonacci number is 233.
So last two digits are 3 and 3.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 255

Output:
70

Explanation:
The 255th fibonacci number is  875715953430-
18854458033386304178158174356588264390370.
Thus, last two digits are 7 and 0.


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything.

Your task is to complete the function fibonacciDigits() 
which takes a number N as input parameter and returns 
the last two digits of the Nth fibonacci number.


Expected Time Complexity:O(K)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(K)

K is of the order 10^2.


Constraints:
1<=N<=10^18
