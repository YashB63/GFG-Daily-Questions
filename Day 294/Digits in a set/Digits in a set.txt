Given a number n, count the numbers from 1 to n, 
which comprise only digits from set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.


Examples:

Input: n = 20

Output: 10

Explanation: The numbers whose digits are from the 
given set are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.


Input: n = 100

Output: 30


Expected Time Complexity: O(n * number of digits in an integer)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
