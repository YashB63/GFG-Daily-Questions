Given a string, find the minimum number of characters 
to be inserted to convert it to a palindrome.


Examples :

Input: str = "abcd"

Output: 3

Explanation: Inserted character marked
with bold characters in dcbabcd


Input: str = "aa"

Output: 0

Explanation:"aa" is already a palindrome.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n2), n = |str|
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n2)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |str| ≤ 500
str contains only lower case alphabets.
