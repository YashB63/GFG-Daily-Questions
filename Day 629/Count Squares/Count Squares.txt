Given a positive integer n, find the number 
of perfect squares that are less than n in 
the sample space of perfect squares. 

The sample space consists of all perfect 
squares starting from 1 
(i.e., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, â€¦)


Examples :

Input: n = 9

Output: 2

Explanation: 1 and 4 are the only 
Perfect Squares less than 9. 

So, the Output is 2.


Input: n = 3

Output: 1

Explanation: 1 is the only 
Perfect Square less than 3. 

So, the Output is 1.


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^8
