Given an array, arr[] of integers, your task 
is to return the smallest and second smallest 
element in the array. 

If the smallest and second smallest do not 
exist, return -1.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 3, 5, 6]

Output: [2, 3] 

Explanation: 2 and 3 are respectively the 
smallest and second smallest elements in 
the array.


Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1]

Output: [-1]

Explanation: Only element is 1 which is smallest, 
so there is no second smallest element.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size ≤10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
