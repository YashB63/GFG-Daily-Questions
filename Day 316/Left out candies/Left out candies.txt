Given n students sitting in a circle, 
distribute m candies to these students. 

The ith student can take only i candies. 

If ith student does not get the required 
amount of candies he will not take it. 

Distribute the candies starting from the 1st 
student and moving along the circle of students 
till you reach a student you can not give candies to. 

You need to find the amount of candies left.


Examples:

Input: n = 4, m = 11

Output: 0

2 to 2nd , 3 to 3rd , 4 to 4th then again 1 to first. 

All candies are finished with none left out.


Input: n = 4, m = 12

Output: 1

Explanation: You are left with only one candy.
