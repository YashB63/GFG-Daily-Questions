Given a binary array arr[] and an integer target, 
return the number of non-empty subarrays with a 
sum equal to the target.

Note: A subarray is the contiguous 
part of the array.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], target = 2

Output: 4

Explanation: There are four subarrays with 
sum equal to target: arr[0..2], arr[0..3], 
arr[1..4], arr[2..4].


Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], target = 5

Output: 0

Explanation: There are no subarrays with sum target.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ target ≤ arr.size()
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1
