Ritu has all numbers from 2 to n in an array, 
arr of length n-1 except one number. 

You have to return the missing number, 
Ritu doesn't have from 1 to n.

Note: Don't use Sorting


Examples:

Input: n = 4, arr = [1,  4,  3]

Output: 2     

Explanation: Ritu doesn't have the number 2


Input: n = 5, arr = [2,  5,  3,  1]

Output: 4

Explanation: Ritu doesn't have number 4 in her collection


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxillary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
arr.szie = n-1
