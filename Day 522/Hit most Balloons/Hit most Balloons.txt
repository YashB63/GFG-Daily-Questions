You are given an infinite two-dimensional grid. 

There are N balloons placed at 
certain coordinates of the grid. 

You have an arrow with yourself, 
which you will be using to shoot 
the balloons. 

You can select any point on the grid 
as your starting point and any point 
on the grid as the target point.

When you fire the arrow, all ballons 
lying on the shortest path between the 
starting point and target point will be 
burst. 

Given the coordinates of the N ballons in 
an array arr, your task is to find out the 
maximum number of balloons that you can fire 
in one arrow shot.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}}

Output:
3

Explanation:
If you position yourself at point (1,2)
and fire the arrow aiming at the point (3,4).
Then all the balloons will burst.


Example 2:

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {{2,2}, {0,0}, {1,2}} 

Output:
2

Explanation: 
If you position yourself at point (2,2)
and fire the arrow aiming at the point (0,0).
Then the two balloons present at the two points
will burst.


Your Task:

Complete the function mostBalloons() which 
takes the integers N and the array arr as 
the input parameters, and returns the 
maximum number of balloons that can be 
burst using one arrow.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N^2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3
-10^9 ≤ arr[i][j] ≤ 10^9
