You are given an array arr[] of n 
integers and q queries in an array 
queries[] of length 2*q containing l, 
r pair for all q queries. 

You need to compute the following 
sum over q queries.

Note : Array is 1-Indexed.


Examples :

Input: n = 4, arr = {1, 2, 3, 4}, 
q = 2, queries = {1, 4, 2, 3}

Output: 10 5

Explaination: In the first query we need 
sum from 1 to 4 which is 1+2+3+4 = 10. 

In the second query we need sum 
from 2 to 3 which is 2 + 3 = 5.


Input: n = 5, arr = {26, 30, 48, 29, 8}, 
q = 2, queries = {4, 4, 2, 3}

Output: 29 78

Explaination: In the first query we 
need sum from 4 to 4 which is 29. 

In the second query we need sum from
2 to 3 which is 30 + 48 = 78.


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function querySum() 
which takes n, arr, q and queries as input 
parameters and returns the answer for all 
the queries.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n+q)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:
1 ≤ n, q ≤ 105
1 ≤ arri ≤ 103
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n
