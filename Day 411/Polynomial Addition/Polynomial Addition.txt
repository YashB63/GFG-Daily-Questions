Given two polynomial numbers represented by a linked list. 

The task is to add these lists meaning the 
coefficients with the same variable powers.

Note:  Given polynomials are sorted 
in decreasing order of power.


Examples:

Input: LinkedList1: x2, LinkedList2: x3

Output: x3 + x2

Explanation: Since, x2 and x3 both 
have different powers as 2 and 3. 

So, their coefficient can't be added up.


Input: LinkedList1:  x3 -> 2x2, 
LinkedList2:  3x3 -> 4x2

Output: 4x3 -> 6x2

Explanation: Since, x3 has two 
different coefficients as 3 and 1. 

Adding them up will lead to 4x3. 

Also, x2 has two coefficients as 4 and 2. 

So, adding them up will give 6x2.

Note: Try to solve the question 
without using any extra space.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n+m)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= no. of nodes LinkedList1, LinkedList2 <= 10^5
1 <= node->data <= 10^6
