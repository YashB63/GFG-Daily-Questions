Given a binary tree, you have 
to return the size of it. 

Size of binary tree is defined 
as number of nodes in it.


Examples:

Input:      
       1
     /  \
    2    3

Output: 3

Explanation: There are three nodes 
in given binary tree.


Input:
      10
     /  \
   5     9
   \    / \
    1 3   6

Output: 6

Explanation: There are six nodes 
in given binary tree.


Input:
      1
Output: 1

Explanation: There is one nodes in given binary tree.


Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes <= 10^5
1 <= node->data <= 10^5
