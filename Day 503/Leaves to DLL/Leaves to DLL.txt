Given a Binary Tree, extract all 
its leaf nodes to form a Doubly 
Link List starting from the 
leftmost leaf. 

Modify the original tree to make 
the DLL thus removing the leaf 
nodes from the tree. 

Consider the left and right pointers 
of the tree to be the previous and 
next pointer of the DLL respectively.

Note: The generated output will 
contain the in-order traversal 
of the modified tree, the DLL 
from left to right, and the 
DLL from right to left.


Examples:

Input:

Output: 
Modified Tree :

Doubly Linked List :
4 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 7

Explanation:
The leaf nodes are modified 
to form the DLL in-place. 

Thus their links are removed 
from  the tree.


Input:

Output: 
Modified Tree :

Doubly Linked List:
4 <-> 5 <-> 3


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(height of tree)


Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes in tree, data of nodes ≤ 10^4
