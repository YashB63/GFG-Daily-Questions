You are given two integers n and k. 

Your task is to implement a class kQueues that uses a 
single array of size n to simulate k independent queues.

The class should support the following operations:

enqueue(x, i) → Adds the element x into the i-th queue.

dequeue(i) → Removes the front element from the i-th queue and returns it. 
Returns -1 if the queue is empty.

isEmpty(i) → Returns true if i-th queue is empty, else return false.

isFull() → Returns true if the array is completely full 
and no more elements can be inserted, otherwise false.

There will be a sequence of q queries represented as:

1 x i : Call enqueue(x, i)
2 i : Call dequeue(i)
3 i : Call isEmpty(i)
4 : Call isFull()

The driver code will process the queries, call the 
corresponding functions, and print the results of 
dequeue, isEmpty, and isFull operations.

You only need to implement the above four functions.


Examples:

Input: n = 4, k = 2, q = 8,
queries = [[1, 5, 0], [1, 3, 0], [1, 1, 1], [2, 0], [1, 4, 1], [1, 1, 0], [3, 1], [4]] 

Output: [5, false, true] 

Explanation: Queries on the queue are as follows: 
enqueue(5, 0) → queue0 = [5]
enqueue(3, 0) → queue0 = [5, 3]
enqueue(1, 1) → queue1 = [1]
dequeue(0) → returns 5, queue0 = [3]
enqueue(4, 1) → queue1 = [1, 4]
enqueue(1, 0) → queue0 = [3, 1]
isEmpty(1) → false
isFull() → true


Input: n = 6, k = 3, q = 4,
queries = [[1, 3, 2], [2, 0], [1, 2, 1], [3, 2]] 

Output: [-1, false] 

Explanation: Queries on the queue are as follows: 
enqueue(3, 2) → queue2 = [3]
dequeue(0) → queue0 is empty, returns -1
enqueue(2, 1) → queue1 = [2]
isEmpty(2) → false


Constraints:

1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ values on the queues ≤ 10^9
