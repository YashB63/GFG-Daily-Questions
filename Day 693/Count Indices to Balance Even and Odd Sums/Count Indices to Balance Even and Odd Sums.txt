Given an array arr[], count the number of indices 
such that deleting the element at that index and 
shifting all elements after it one position left 
results in an array where the sum of elements at 
even indices equals the sum at odd indices.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 6, 4]

Output: 1

Explaination: After removing arr[1], the resulting 
array will be [2, 6, 4] the sums of elements at 
odd index is arr[1] = 6 and the sum of elements at 
even index is arr[0] + arr[2] = 6.


Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1]

Output: 3

Explaination: Removing any element makes the 
sum of odd and even indexed elements equal.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4
