Given a sorted array arr[] and a number target, the task is 
to find the lower bound of the target in this given array. 

The lower bound of a number is defined as the smallest index 
in the sorted array where the element is greater than or 
equal to the given number.

Note: If all the elements in the given array are smaller 
than the target, the lower bound will be the length of 
the array. 


Examples :

Input:  arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 9

Output: 3

Explanation: 3 is the smallest index in arr[] where 
element (arr[3] = 10) is greater than or equal to 9.


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 11

Output: 4

Explanation: 4 is the smallest index in arr[] where 
element (arr[4] = 11) is greater than or equal to 11.


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 100

Output: 7

Explanation: As no element in arr[] is greater 
than 100, return the length of array.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ target ≤ 10^6
