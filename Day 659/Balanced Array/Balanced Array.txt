Given an array arr of even size, the task is to find a 
minimum value that can be added to an element so that 
the array becomes balanced.

An array is balanced if the sum of the left half of the 
array elements is equal to the sum of the right half.


Examples :

Input: arr = [1, 5, 3, 2]

Output: 1

Explanation: Sum of first 2 elements is 1 + 5  = 6, 
Sum of last 2 elements is 3 + 2  = 5, To make the 
array balanced you can add 1.


Input: arr = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3]

Output: 2

Explanation: Sum of first 3 elements is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, 
Sum of last three elements is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6, To make 
the array balanced you can add 2.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

2<=arr.size()<=10^7 where arr.size() is even.
1<=arr[i]<=10^5
