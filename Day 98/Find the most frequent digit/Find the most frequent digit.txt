Given a number N, find the most occurring digit in it. 

If two or more digits occur same number of times, 
then return the highest of them. 

Input number is given as a string.

Example 1:

Input:
N = "12234"

Output:
2

Explanation :
2 occurs most times


Example 2:

Input:
N = "1122"

Output:
2

Explanation :
1 and 2 occurs most times but 2 > 1.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function solve() 
that receives a string N as input parameter and 
returns the most frequent digit in it as a string.

Expected Time Complexity : O(len(N))
Expected Space Complexity : O(1)

Constraints:
1<= len(N) <=101000
