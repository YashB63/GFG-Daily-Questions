Given two strings s1 and s2 in lowercase, 
the task is to make them anagrams. 

The only allowed operation is to remove 
a character from any string. 

Find the minimum number of characters to be 
deleted to make both the strings anagram. 

Two strings are called anagrams of each 
other if one of them can be converted 
into another by rearranging its letters.


Examples:

Input: s1 = "bcadeh", s2 = "hea"

Output: 3

Explanation: We need to 
remove b, c and d from s1.


Input: s1 = "cddgk", s2 = "gcd"

Output: 2

Explanation: We need to 
remove d and k from s1.


Constraints:
1 <= |s1|, |s2| <= 10^5
