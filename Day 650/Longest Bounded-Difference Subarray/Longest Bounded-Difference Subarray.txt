Given an array of positive integers arr[] 
and a non-negative integer x, the task is 
to find the longest sub-array where the 
absolute difference between any two 
elements is not greater than x.

If multiple such subarrays exist, 
return the one that starts at the 
smallest index.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [8, 4, 5, 6, 7], x = 3
 
Output: [4, 5, 6, 7] 

Explanation: The sub-array described 
by index [1..4], i.e. [4, 5, 6, 7]

contains no two elements whose absolute 
difference is greater than 3.


Input: arr[] = [1, 10, 12, 13, 14], x = 2 

Output: [12, 13, 14] 

Explanation: The sub-array described 
by index [2..4], i.e. [12, 13, 14]

contains no two elements whose absolute 
differnece is greater than 2. 


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
0 ≤ x ≤ 10^9
