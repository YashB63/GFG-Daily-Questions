You are given a 2D matrix grid[][] of size n*m, 
where each cell grid[i][j] represents the number 
of chocolates available at position (i, j).

Two robots are collecting chocolates from this grid:

Robot 1 starts at the top-left corner (0, 0)

Robot 2 starts at the top-right corner (0, m - 1)

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of chocolates 
both robots can collect while following these rules:

From a cell (i, j), robots can move to cell (i + 1, j - 1), 
(i + 1, j), or (i + 1, j + 1).

When a robot visits a cell, it collects 
all the chocolates there.

If both robots land on the same cell, the chocolates 
in that cell are collected only once.

Robots cannot move outside the boundaries 
of the grid.

Both robots must continue moving until 
they reach the bottom row of the grid.


Example:

Input: grid[][] = [[4, 1, 2], [3, 6, 1], [1, 6, 6], [3, 1, 2]]

Output: 32

Explanation: The path followed by first robot is: 
(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 0), so first 
robot collected: 4 + 3 + 6 + 3 = 16 chocolates.

The path followed by second robot is: (0, 2) -> 
(1, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2), so second robot 
collected: 2 + 6 + 6 + 2 = 16 chocolates.

Total both robots collected 16 + 16 = 32 chocolates.


Constraint:

2 ≤ n, m ≤ 70
0 ≤ grid[i][j] ≤ 100
