Given an array arr[] consisting of n integers, 
the task is to find all the array elements 
which occurs more than floor(n/3) times.

Note: The returned array of majority 
elements should be sorted.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 2]

Explanation: The frequency of 1 and 2 is 3, 
which is more than floor n/3 (8/3 = 2).


Input:  arr[] = [-5, 3, -5]

Output: [-5]

Explanation: The frequency of -5 is 2, 
which is more than floor n/3 (3/3 = 1).


Input:  arr[] = [3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4]

Output: []

Explanation: There is no majority element.


Constraint:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
-10^5 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
