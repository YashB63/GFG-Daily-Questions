You are given a string s. 

You need to reverse each word in it 
where the words are separated by 
spaces and return the modified 
string.

Note: The string may contain leading 
or trailing spaces, or multiple 
spaces between two words. 

The returned string should only have a 
single space separating the words, and 
no extra spaces should be included.


Examples:

Input: s = " i like this program very much "

Output: "i ekil siht margorp yrev hcum"

Explanation: The words are reversed as follows:
"i" -> "i","like"->"ekil",
"this"->"siht","program" -> "margorp",
"very" -> "yrev","much" -> "hcum".


Input: s = " pqr mno "

Output: "rqp onm"

Explanation: The words are reversed as follows:
"pqr" -> "rqp" ,
"mno" -> "onm"


Input: s = "pqr"

Output: "rqp"

Explanation: The words are reversed as follows:
"pqr" -> "rqp"


Constraints:

1 <= s.size() <= 10^5
string s contains only lowercase 
English alphabets and spaces
