Given a directed graph with V nodes and E 
edges, the graph's edges are represented 
as a 2D array, edges[][]. 

Each row in the array represents a directed 
edge (u, v), meaning there is a directed 
edge from node u to node v. 

If there is a directed edge from u to v, 
it means that u depends on v. 

The Number of Dependencies (NoD) for a node x is 
the total count of nodes that x depends upon.

Your task is to calculate the sum of the Number 
of Dependencies (NoD) for all nodes in the graph.


Examples:

Input: V = 4, E = 4, edges[][] = [[0,2],[0,3],[1,3],[2,3]]

Output: 4

Explanation: For the graph in diagram, 
A depends on C and D i.e. A's NoD is 2, 
B depends on D i.e. B's NoD is 1, C 
depends on D i.e. D's NoD is 1 and D 
depends on none. 

Hence answer is 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4.


Input: V = 4, E = 3, edges[][] = [[0,3],[0,2],[0,1]]

Output: 3

Explanation: The sum of dependencies: 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.


Constraints:

1 <= V <= 10^5
1 <= E <= 10^5
edges.size() = E
edges[i].size() = 2
0 <= edges[i][j] <= V-1
