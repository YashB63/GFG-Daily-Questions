You are given two integers l and r. 

Find the result after applying the series 
of Bitwise AND ( & ) operation on every 
natural number between the range l to r 
(including both).


Examples:

Input: l = 8, r = 13

Output: 8

Explanation: 
8 AND 9 AND 10 AND 11 AND 12 AND 13 = 8.


Input: l = 2, r = 3

Output: 2

Explanation: 2 AND 3 = 2.


Constraints:
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9
