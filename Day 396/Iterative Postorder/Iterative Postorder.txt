Given a binary tree. 

Find the postorder traversal of the tree without using recursion. 

Return a list containing the postorder traversal 
of the tree, calculated without using recursion.


Examples :

Input:
           1
         /   \
        2     3
      /  \
     4    5

Output: 4 5 2 3 1

Explanation: Postorder traversal (Left->Right->Root) 
of the tree is 4 5 2 3 1.


Input:
             8
          /      \
        1          5
         \       /   \
          7     10    6
           \   /
            10 6

Output: 10 7 1 6 10 6 5 8 

Explanation: Postorder traversal (Left->Right->Root) 
of the tree is 10 7 1 6 10 6 5 8 .
 

Expected time complexity: O(n)
Expected auxiliary space: O(n)
 

Constraints:
