It is raining in Geek City. 

The height of the buildings in the 
city is given in an array arr[]. 

Calculate the amount of water that can 
be collected between all the buildings.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 0, 2, 0, 4]

Output: 7

Explanation:
Geek city looks like

We can trap "3 units" of water between 3 and 2, 
"1 unit" on top of bar 2 and "3 units" between 
2 and 4. 


Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]

Output: 6

Explanation:
The structure is like below

Trap "1 unit" between first 1 and 2, 
"4 units" between first 2 and 3 and 
"1 unit" between second last 1 and 
last 2.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^3
