Given a singly linked list. 

The task is to swap elements in the linked list pairwise. 

For example, if the input list is 1 2 3 4, the 
resulting list after swaps will be 2 1 4 3.

Note: You need to swap the nodes, not only the data. 

If only data is swapped then the driver code will print -1.


Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->2->4->5->6->7->8

Output: 2 1 4 2 6 5 8 7

Explanation: After swapping each pair considering 
(1,2), (2, 4), (5, 6).. so on as pairs, 
we get 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 5, 8, 7 as a new linked list.


Input: LinkedList: 1->3->4->7->9->10->1

Output: 3 1 7 4 10 9 1

Explanation: After swapping each pair considering 
(1,3), (4, 7), (9, 10).. so on as pairs, we get 
3, 1, 7, 4, 10, 9, 1 as a new linked list.


Your Task:

The task is to complete the function pairWiseSwap() which 
takes the head node as the only argument and returns 
the head of modified linked list.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ size of linked list ≤ 10^5
