Given an array arr of positive integers. 

Reverse every sub-array group of size k.

Note: If at any instance, k is greater 
or equal to the array size, 
then reverse the entire array. 

You shouldn't return any array, 
modify the given array in place.


Examples:

Input: k = 3, arr= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]

Explanation: First group consists of elements 1, 2, 3. 

Second group consists of 4,5.


Input: k = 5, arr = [5, 6, 8, 9]

Output: [9, 8, 6, 5]

Explnation: Since k is greater than array size, 
the entire array is reversed.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size(), k ≤ 10^7
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^18
