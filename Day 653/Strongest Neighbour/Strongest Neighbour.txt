You are given an array arr[] 
consisting of positive integers. 

Return the maximum of every 
adjacent pairs in the array.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: [2, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Explanation: Maximum of arr[0] and arr[1] is 2, 
that of arr[1] and arr[2] is 2, ... and so on.


Input: arr[] = [5, 5]

Output: [5]

Explanation: We only have two elements 
so max of 5 and 5 is 5 only.


Constraints:

2 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
