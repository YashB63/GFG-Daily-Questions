Given an encoded string s, decode it by 
expanding the pattern k[substring], 
where the substring inside brackets is 
written k times. 

k is guaranteed to be a positive integer, 
and encodedString contains only lowercase 
english alphabets. 

Return the final decoded string.

Note: The test cases are generated so that the 
length of the output string will never exceed 10^5.


Examples:

Input: s = "3[b2[ca]]"

Output: "bcacabcacabcaca"

Explanation:
Inner substring “2[ca]” breakdown into “caca”.

Now, new string becomes “3[bcaca]”

Similarly “3[bcaca]” becomes “bcacabcacabcaca” 
which is final result.


Input: s = "3[ab]"

Output: "ababab"

Explanation: The substring "ab" is 
repeated 3 times giving "ababab".


Constraints:

1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5 
1 ≤ k ≤ 100
