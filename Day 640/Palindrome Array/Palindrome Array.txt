Given an array arr, the task is to find 
whether the arr is palindrome or not. 

If the arr is palindrome then return 
true else return false.

An array is said to be palindrome if its 
reverse array matches the original array. 


Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]

Output: true

Explanation: Here we can see we have 
[1, 2, 3, 2, 1] if we reverse it we 
can find [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] which is 
the same as before. So, the answer 
is true.


Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: Here we can see we have 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] if we reverse it we 
find [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] which is the not 
same as before. So, the answer false.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
