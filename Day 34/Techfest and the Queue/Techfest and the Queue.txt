A Techfest is underway, and each participant 
is given a ticket with a unique number. Organizers 
decide to award prize points to everyone 
who has a ticket ID between a and b (inclusive). 

The points given to a participant with 
ticket number x will be the sum of powers of the prime factors of x.

For instance, if points are to be awarded 
to a participant with ticket number 12, 
the amount of points given out will be 
equal to the sum of powers in the prime factorization 
of 12 (2^2 Ã— 3^1), which will be 2 + 1 = 3.

Given a and b, determine the sum of all the points 
that will be awarded to the participants with ticket 
numbers between a and b (inclusive).


Example 1:

Input: 
a = 9
b = 12

Output: 
8

Explanation: 
For 9, prime factorization is:3^2 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 2
For 10, prime factorization is : 2^1x5^1 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 2
For 11, prime factorization is : 11^1 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 1
For 12, prime factorization is : 2^2x 3^1 
So, sum of powers of primes is: 3
Therefore the total sum is 2+2+1+3=8.


Example 2:

Input: 
a = 24, b = 27

Output: 
11

Explanation: 
For 24, prime factorization is: 2^3x3^1 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 4
For 25, prime factorization is : 52 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 2
For 26, prime factorization is : 13^1x2^1 
So, sum of the powers of primes is: 2
For 27, prime factorization is : 3^3  
So, sum of powers of primes is: 3
Therefore the total sum is 4+2+2+3=11.

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function sumOfPowers() 
which takes a and b as input parameters and returns 
the sum of the power of primes that occur in 
prime factorization of the numbers between a to b (inclusive).

Expected Time Complexity: O( b*log(b) )
Expected Space Complexity: O( b*log(b) )

Constraints:
1 <= a <= b <= 2x10^5
1 <= b-a <= 10^5
