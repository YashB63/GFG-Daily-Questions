You are given a binary array arr[], 
where each element is either 0 or 1. 

Your task is to rearrange the array 
in increasing order in place (without 
using extra space). 

You do not need to return anything; 
simply modify the input array.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Explanation: After arranging the elements in 
increasing order, elements will be as 0 0 1 1 1.


Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Explanation: After arranging the elements 
in increasing order, elements will be 
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1.


Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Explanation: Since the array already 
contains only 1s, no change is needed.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
arr[i] ∈ {0,1} for all valid indices i.
