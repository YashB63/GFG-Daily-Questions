Given a number n find the prime 
factorization of the number.

Note: Print the prime factors 
in non-decreasing order.


Examples:

Input: n = 100

Output: 2 2 5 5

Explanation: 100 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 5


Input: n = 27

Output: 3 3 3

Explanation: 27 = 3 * 3 * 3 


Constraint:
2 <= n <= 200
