Given a Binary Tree, write a function to check 
whether the given Binary Tree is a prefect 
Binary Tree or not. 

A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which 
all internal nodes have two children and all 
leaves are at same level.


Example 1:

Input: 
          7
      /  \
     4    9

Output: YES

Explanation: 
As the root node 7 has two children and 
two leaf nodes 4 and 9 are at same level 
so it is a perfect binary tree.


Example 2:

Input: 
                   7
              /   \
             3     8
           /   \     \
          2     5     10
        /
       1

Output: NO


Your task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function isPerfect() 
which takes root node of the tree as input parameter 
and returns a boolean value.

If the tree is a perfect binary tree 
return true other wise return false.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1<=T<=10^5
1<=N<=10^5
1<=data of node<=10^5
