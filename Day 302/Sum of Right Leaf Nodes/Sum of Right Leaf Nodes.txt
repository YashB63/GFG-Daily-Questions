Given a Binary Tree. 

Your task is to complete the function 
rightLeafSum(), which should return the 
sum of all the leaf nodes that are the 
right child of their parent of the given 
binary tree.


Examples:

Input :

          52
        /    \
      12      55
     /  \     /  \
    83   6   17  82
   /    /  \   
  56   61  35

Output : 117

Explanation: All the right leaf nodes presents 
are 35, 82 which sums up to 117


Input:
         12
        /  \    
     20     30
    /  \     /
  40   60  90

Output: 60

Explanation: The only right leaf node is present is 60


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Space Complexity: O(Height of the Tree)


Constraints:

1<=number of nodes<=10^6
1<= data of nodes <=10^4

It is guaranteed that sum will 
not exceed integer max value
