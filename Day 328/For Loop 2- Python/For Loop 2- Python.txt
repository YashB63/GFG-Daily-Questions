Welcome to the part 2 of For Loops in Python. 

In this question, we'll learn to print 
characters of a string at even indices.

You are given a string str, you need to print 
its characters at even indices(index starts at 0).

Note: Please go through the range function 
to understand how to jump 2 steps.


Example 1:

Input:
str = DoctorPhenomenal

Output:
DcoPeoea


Example 2:

Input:
str = Geeks

Output:
Ges


Your Task:

This is a function problem. 

You don't need to take input. 

Just complete the function 
stringJumper() that takes 
str as input.
