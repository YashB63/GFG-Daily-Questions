Given an Array of Integers Arr of length N, 
you have to count number of elements of the array 
that can be counted as pair of equal elements.


Example 1:

Input : 
N = 7
Arr[] = {10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 10, 20}
Output:
6
Explanation:
The pairs formed are: (10,10),
(10,10), (20,20). The leftover 10
can't be paired with any other 10.
So, the Output is 6.


Example 2:

Input : 
N = 4
Arr = {10, 20, 30, 40}
Output:
0
Explanation:
No pairs can be formed.
So, the Output is 0.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function getTwinCount() 
which takes an Integer N and an Array Arr as input and returns the answer.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 10^5
