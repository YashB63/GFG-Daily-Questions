You are given an integer array arr[]. 

You need to push the elements of the array into 
a stack and then print them while popping.

Note: No need to print extra line after 
printing the stack elements.


Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: 5 4 3 2 1

Explanation: Elements are pushed and then popped from 
the top of the stack in the order 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.


Input: arr = [1, 6, 43, 1, 2, 0, 5]

Output: 5 0 2 1 43 6 1


Constraints:
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^7
