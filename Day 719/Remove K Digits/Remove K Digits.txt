Given a non-negative integer s represented as 
a string and an integer k, remove exactly k 
digits from the string so that the resulting 
number is the smallest possible, while 
maintaining the relative order of the 
remaining digits.

Note : The resulting number must not 
contain any leading zeros.

If the resulting number is an empty string 
after the removal, return "0".


Examples:

Input: s = "4325043", k = 3

Output: 2043

Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 5 
to form the new number "2043" which is smallest 
among all possible removal.


Input: s = "765028321", k = 5

Output: 221

Explanation: Remove the five digits 7, 6, 5, 8 
and 3 to form the new number "0221". 

Since we are not supposed to keep leading 0s, 
we get "221".


Constraints:
1 ≤ k ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6
