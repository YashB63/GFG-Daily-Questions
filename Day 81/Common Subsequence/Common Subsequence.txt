Given two strings a and b. 
Check whether they contain any 
common subsequence (non empty) or not.


Example 1:

Input:
a = "ABEF" b = "CADE"
Output: 1
Explanation: Subsequence "AE" occurs
in both the strings.


Example 2:

Input: 
a = "ABCD", b = "EFGH"
Output: 0
Explanation: There's no common subsequence
in both the strings.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function commonSubseq() 
which takes the string a and string b as inputs and 
returns true if there's a common subsequence in both the strings. 
Else, it returns false.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|a| + |b|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
2 <= |a|, |b| <=10^5
