Given two positive integers x and y, 
determine if y is a power of x. 

If y is a power of x, return True. 

Otherwise, return False.


Examples:

Input: x = 2, y = 8

Output: True 

Explanation: 23 is equal to 8.


Input: x = 1, y = 8

Output: False

Explanation: Any power of 1 is not equal to 8.


Constraints: 

1 <= x <= 10^3
1 <= y <= 10^8
