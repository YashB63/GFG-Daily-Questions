Given a number n. 

Find the length of the longest consecutive 
1s in its binary representation.


Examples:

Input: n = 14

Output: 3

Explanation: Binary representation of 14 is 1110, 
in which 111 is the longest consecutive set bits 
of length is 3.


Input: n = 222

Output: 4

Explanation: Binary representation of 222 is 11011110, 
in which 1111 is the longest consecutive set bits of 
length 4. 


Constraints :
 1  ≤ n ≤ 10^9
