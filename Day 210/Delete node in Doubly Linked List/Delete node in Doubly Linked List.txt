Given a doubly Linked list and a position. 

The task is to delete a node from a given position 
(position starts from 1) in a doubly linked list 
and return the head of the doubly Linked list.


Examples:

Input: LinkedList = 1 <--> 3 <--> 4, x = 3

Output: 1 3  

Explanation: 
After deleting the node at position 3 
(position starts from 1),the linked list 
will be now as 1 <--> 3.
 

Input: LinkedList = 1 <--> 5 <--> 2 <--> 9, x = 1

Output: 5 2 9

Explanation:


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
2 <= size of the linked list(n) <= 10^5
1 <= x <= n
1 <= node.data <= 10^9
