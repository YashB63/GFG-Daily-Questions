Consider the set of irreducible fractions 
A = {n/d | n≤d and d ≤ 10000 and gcd(n,d) = 1}.

You are given a member of this set and your task 
is to find the largest fraction in this set less 
than the given fraction.

Note: The fraction that is given to you may or 
may not be irreducible.


Example 1:

Input: n = 1, d = 4

Output: {2499, 9997} 
 
Explanation: 2499/9997 is the largest fraction.


Example 2:

Input: n = 2, d = 5

Output: {3999, 9998}

Explanation: 3999/9998 is the largest fraction. 


Your Task:  

You dont need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function numAndDen() which takes n 
and d as input parameter and returns the numerator 
and the denominator of the required irreducible fraction.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= n <= d <=1000
