You are given an array arr[] representing the 
heights of pillars on a track. 

The track is considered valid if it 
satisfies the following conditions:

1)There is a constant, non-zero difference 
  between the heights of consecutive pillars.

2)The height of the middle pillar must be exactly 1.

3)The number of pillars on both sides of the middle 
  pillar must be equal, and the heights of the corresponding 
  pillars on each side must be identical.

Return true if the track is valid, otherwise, return false.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 2]

Output: true

Explanation: The track is valid because it has a 
constant height difference of 1, the middle pillar is 1, 
and both sides of the middle pillar have an equal number 
of identical height pillars.


Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 2, 3, 4]

Output: false


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
3 <= arr.size()<= 10^6
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
