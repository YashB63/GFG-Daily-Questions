Given two integers n and k, The task is to 
calculate Permutation Coefficient P(n,k).

Note:  P(n, k) is used to represent the number 
of ways to obtain an ordered subset having k 
elements from a set of n elements. 

Since this value may be large only 
find it modulo 10^9 + 7.


Examples :

Input: n = 10, k = 2

Output: 90

Explanation: For first case: Ans = 10! / 
(10 - 2)! = 10! / 8! , 10! is 8!*9*10 and 
8! is 8!, Ans = 9*10 = 90.


Input: n = 10, k = 3

Output: 720


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
0 ≤ k ≤ n
