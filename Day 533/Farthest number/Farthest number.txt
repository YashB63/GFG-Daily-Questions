Given an array arr[] of size n. 

For every element in the array, 
your task is to find the index 
of the farthest element in the 
array to the right which is 
smaller than the current element. 

If no such number exists then print -1.

Note: 0 based indexing is followed.


Examples:

Input: n = 5, arr[] = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]

Output: [1, -1, 4, -1, -1]

Explanation: arr[3] is the farthest 
smallest element to the right of arr[0], 
arr[4] is the farthest smallest element 
to the right of arr[2].

And for the rest of the elements, 
there is no smaller element to their right.


Input: n = 5, arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]

Output: [4, 4, 4, 4, -1]

Explanation: arr[4] is the farthest smallest 
element to the right for arr[0], arr[1], 
arr[2] and arr[3]. And for arr[4] there is 
no smaller element to the right.


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
