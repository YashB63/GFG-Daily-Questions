A number n is represented in Linked List 
such that each digit corresponds to a 
node in linked list. 

You need to add 1 to it. 

Returns the head of the modified linked list. 

The driver code prints the number.

Note: The head represents the left-most digit of the number.


Examples :

Input: LinkedList: 4->5->6

Output: 457

Explanation: 4->5->6 represents 456 and when 1 is added it becomes 457. 


Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3

Output: 124 

Explanation:  1->2->3 represents 123 and when 1 is added it becomes 124. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^21
