Given two positive integers n and k. 

You have to find the kth smallest factor of n.  

Output the kth smallest factor of 
n if it exists, otherwise print -1.

A factor of n is a positive integer that 
divides n perfectly, i.e., with remainder 0.


Example 1:

Input : n = 4 , k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:
All factors of 4 are 1,2 and 4. Out of
these 2 is the 2nd smallest.


Example 2:

Input : n = 4 , k = 3

Output: 4

Explanation:
All factors of 4 are 1,2 and 4. Out of
these 4 is the 3rd smallest.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
kThSmallestFactor() which takes 2 
Integers n and k as input and returns 
the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n)log(sqrt(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(sqrt(n))


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^8
1 <= k <= 10^8
