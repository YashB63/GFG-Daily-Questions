Given a 2D matrix mat[][], identify any peak element within the matrix.

An element is considered a peak if it is greater than or 
equal to its four immediate neighbors: top, bottom, left, 
and right. 

For corner and edge elements, any missing neighbors are 
treated as having a value of negative infinity.

Note: A peak element is not necessarily the global maximum, 
it only needs to satisfy the condition relative to its 
adjacent elements. 

Multiple peak elements may exist, return any one of them.

Note that the driver code will print true if you return the 
correct position of peak element, else it will print false.


Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[10, 20, 15],           
                [21, 30, 14],
                 [7, 16, 32]]

Output: true

Explanation: One of the peak element is 30 at index (1, 1), 
which is greater than or equal to all its valid neighbors: 
Left = 21, Right = 14, Top = 20, Bottom = 16. 

So, it satisfies the peak condition. 

Alternatively, (2, 2) with value 32 also qualifies as a peak.


Input: mat[][] = [[17, 7],
                [11, 10]]
Output: true

Explanation: 17 is the only peak element at index (0, 0). 

Its neighbors are: Right= 7, Bottom = 11. 

Since 17 is greater than or equal to both 
(and top/left are out of bounds), it qualifies 
as a peak element.


Constraint:

1 ≤ n × m ≤ 10^6
-10^6 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 10^6
