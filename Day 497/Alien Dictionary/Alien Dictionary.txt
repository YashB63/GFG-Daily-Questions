A new alien language uses the 
English alphabet, but the order 
of letters is unknown. 

You are given a list of words[] from 
the alien language’s dictionary, where 
the words are claimed to be sorted 
lexicographically according to the 
language’s rules.

Your task is to determine the correct 
order of letters in this alien language 
based on the given words. 

If the order is valid, return a string 
containing the unique letters in 
lexicographically increasing order as 
per the new language's rules. 

If there are multiple valid orders, 
return any one of them.

However, if the given arrangement of 
words is inconsistent with any possible 
letter ordering, return an empty string ("").

A string a is lexicographically smaller 
than a string b if, at the first position 
where they differ, the character in a 
appears earlier in the alien language 
than the corresponding character in b. 

If all characters in the shorter word 
match the beginning of the longer word, 
the shorter word is considered smaller.

Note: Your implementation will 
be tested using a driver code. 

It will print true if your 
returned order correctly 
follows the alien language’s 
lexicographic rules; 
otherwise, it will print false.


Examples:

Input: words[] = ["baa", "abcd", "abca", "cab", "cad"]

Output: true

Explanation: A possible corrct order of 
letters in the alien dictionary is "bdac".

The pair "baa" and "abcd" 
suggests 'b' appears before 
'a' in the alien dictionary.

The pair "abcd" and "abca" 
suggests 'd' appears before 
'a' in the alien dictionary.

The pair "abca" and "cab" 
suggests 'a' appears before 
'c' in the alien dictionary.

The pair "cab" and "cad" 
suggests 'b' appears before 
'd' in the alien dictionary.

So, 'b' → 'd' → 'a' → 'c' is a valid ordering.


Input: words[] = ["caa", "aaa", "aab"]

Output: true

Explanation: A possible corrct order of 
letters in the alien dictionary is "cab".

The pair "caa" and "aaa" suggests 
'c' appears before 'a'.

The pair "aaa" and "aab" suggests 
'a' appear before 'b' in the alien 
dictionary. 

So, 'c' → 'a' → 'b' is a valid ordering.


Input: words[] = ["ab", "cd", "ef", "ad"]

Output: ""

Explanation: No valid ordering of letters is possible.
The pair "ab" and "ef" suggests "a" appears before "e".

The pair "ef" and "ad" suggests "e" appears before "a", 
which contradicts the ordering rules.


Constraints:

1 ≤ words.length ≤ 500
1 ≤ words[i].length ≤ 100
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
