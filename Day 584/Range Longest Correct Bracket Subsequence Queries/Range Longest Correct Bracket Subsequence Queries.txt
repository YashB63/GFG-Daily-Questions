Given a bracket sequence or in other 
words a string S of length N and 
queries Q, consisting of characters 
‘(‘ and ‘)’. 

Find the length of the maximum correct 
bracket subsequence of sequence for a 
given query range from L to R(L and R 
inclusive).

Note: A correct bracket sequence is the
one that has matched bracket pairs or 
which contains another nested correct 
bracket sequence.


Example 1:

Input:
S = ())(())(())( , Q = 2
Queries = {(3,6), (0,11)}

Output:
4
10

Explanation: For query 1, Longest Correct
Bracket Subsequence is (()).Hence length=4
For query 2, Longest Correct Bracket
Subsequence is ()(())(()). Hence length=10


Your Task:

Complete getLongestSequence() function and 
return the maximum length of the correct 
bracket subsequence of the sequence. 

The segment tree array has been prebuilt 
and provided to you.


Expected Time Complexity: O(Q*Log(N)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

1 <= N, Q <= 10^4
0 <= L <= R <= N-1
