Given an array containing distinct integers, find 
the number of surpassers for each of its elements.

An element y is said to be the surpasser of element 
x if it is a greater element on the right of x. 

ie if x = arr[i] and y = arr[j], 
i<j and arr[i] < arr[j]. 


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

Output: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]

Explanation: There are no elements 
greater than 3 at the right of 3. 

There is one element at right 
of 2 and greater than 2. 

There are 2 elements greater 
than 1 at the right of 1. 

And so on.


Input: arr[] = [2, 7, 5, 3, 8, 1]

Output: [4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
