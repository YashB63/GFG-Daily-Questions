Given a string str you have to answer 
several queries on that string. 

In each query you will be provided two 
values L and R and you have to find the 
number of distinct characters in the sub 
string from index L to index R (inclusive) 
of the original string.
 

Example 1:

Input: str = "abcbaed",
Query = {{1,4},{2,4},{1,7}}

Output: {3,2,5}

Explanation: For the first query distinct 
characters from [1, 4] are a, b and c.
For the second query distinct characters from
[2, 4] are b and c.
For the third query distinct characters from
[1, 7] are a, b, c, d and e.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anyhting. 

Your task is to complete the function 
SolveQueries() which takes str and Query 
as input parameter and returns a list 
containing answer for each query.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(max(26*length of str, 26 * No of queries))
Expected Space Complexity: O(26 * length of str)
 

Constraints:

1 <= |str| <= 10^5
1 <= No of Queries <= 10^4
1 <= Li <= Ri <= |str|
