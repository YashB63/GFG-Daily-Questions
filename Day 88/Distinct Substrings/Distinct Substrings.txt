Given a string s consisting of uppercase and 
lowercase alphabetic characters. 

Return the  number of distinct substrings 
of size 2 that appear in s as contiguous substrings.


Example 1:

Input :
s = "ABCAB"
Output :
3
Explanation:  For "ABCAB", the 
three distinct substrings of size 
2 are "AB", "BC" and "CA". 


Example 2:

Input :
s = "XYZ"
Output :
2
Explanation: For "XYZ", the 
two distinct substrings of size 2 are
"XY" and "YZ".
Your Task :

You don't need to read input or print anything. 
You have to complete the function fun() which takes 
the string s as input parameter and returns 
the number of distinct contiguous substring of size 2.

Expected Time Complexity : O(|s|)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(|s|)

Constraints:
1<=|s|<=100

|s| denotes the length of the string s.
