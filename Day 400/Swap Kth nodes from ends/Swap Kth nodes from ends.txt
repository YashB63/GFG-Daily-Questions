A singly linked list and an integer of k are given. 

You need to swap the kth node from the beginning 
and the kth node from the end of the linked list. 

Swap the nodes through the links. 

Do not change the content of the nodes.

Note: The driver code will output "true" 
if you successfully swap the nodes.


Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4, k = 1

Output: true

Explanation: Here k = 1, hence after swapping the 
1st node from the beginning and end the new list 
will be 4->2->3->1. 


Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5, k = 7

Output: true

Explanation: k > n. 

Swapping is invalid. 

Return the head node as it is.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxillary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes <= 10^3
1 <= node->data <= 10^6
1 <= k <= 10^3
