You are given the head_ref of a 
doubly Linked List and a Key. 

Your task is to delete all occurrences 
of the given key if it is present and 
return the new DLL.


Example1:

Input: 
2<->2<->10<->8<->4<->2<->5<->2
2

Output: 
10<->8<->4<->5

Explanation: 
All Occurences of 2 have been deleted.


Example2:

Input: 
9<->1<->3<->4<->5<->1<->8<->4
9

Output: 
1<->3<->4<->5<->1<->8<->4

Explanation: 
All Occurences of 9 have been deleted.


Your Task:

Complete the function void deleteAllOccurOfX
(struct Node** head_ref, int key), which 
takes the reference of the head pointer and 
an integer value key. 

Delete all occurrences of 
the key from the given DLL.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

1<=Number of Nodes<=10^5
0<=Node Value <=10^9
