Given a string str consisting of only 
uppercase and lowercase characters. 

The task is to sort uppercase and lowercase 
letters separately such that if the ith 
place in the original string had an 
Uppercase character then it should not 
have a lowercase character after being 
sorted and vice versa.


Examples :

Input: n = 12, str = defRTSersUXI

Output: deeIRSfrsTUX

Explanation: Sorted form of given string with 
the same case of character as that in original 
string is deeIRSfrsTUX


Input: n = 6, str = srbDKi

Output: birDKs

Explanation: Sorted form of given string with the same 
case of character will result in output as birDKs.


Your Task:

You only need to complete the function caseSort 
that takes a string str and length of the string 
n and returns sorted string.


Expected Time Complexity: O(nlog(n)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
