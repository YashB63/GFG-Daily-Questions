Logical operators and, or, not are used in condition checking. 

Like a and b checks if both a and b are True. 

First a is checked then b is checked. 

a or b checks if either of a or b is True. 

If one is True; it doesn't check for the other. 

not a complements the boolean value of a.

Note: 0 and empty string are False and all 
other values are True.

In this question you basically need to do

a and b
a or b
not a


Examples:

Input: a = 0, b = 2

Output: 0 2 True

Explanation: 0 and 2 gives 0. 0 or 2 gives 2. 

not 0 give True as 0 is False.


Input: a = 3, b = 4 

Output: 4 3 False

Explanation: 3 and 4 gives 4 as 3 is True and 4 
is also True, so all conditions are passed. 

3 or 4 gives 3 as or only checks if either of 
the condition is true and here 3 is True itself 
so it doesn't proceed forward. 

not 3 gives False as 3 was True.
