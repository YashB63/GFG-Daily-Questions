Given an array arr[]. 

The array contains numbers ranging from 0 to k-1 
where k is a positive integer. 

Find the maximum repeating number in this array. 

If there are two or more maximum repeating numbers, 
return the element with the least value.


Examples:

Input: k = 3, arr[] = [2, 2, 1, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: 2 is the most frequent element.


Input: k = 3, arr[] = [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1]

Output: 0

Explanation: 0, 1, and 2 all have the same frequency of 2. 

But since 0 is the smallest, you need to return 0.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ arri ≤ k-1
