In this question, we'll use Regex to validate a password. 

You will be provided a string str which you have to validate.

The validation rules are as follows:

The string is valid only if it 
starts with lowercase characters, 
followed by special characters 
!@#$% followed by numbers.

In any other case the string is not valid.


Example:

Input: 
str = asdsab@!@234

Output: 
True

Explanation: 
The string is valid as characters are

Complete the function validate() 
that takes str as input and returns 
True/False.
