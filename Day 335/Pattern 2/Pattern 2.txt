Geek is very fond of patterns. 

Once, his teacher gave him a 
pattern of triangle to solve. 

He gave Geek an integer n and 
asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a triangle 
pattern using stars(*).


Example 1:

Input:
n = 5

Output:
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * *


Example 2:

Input: 
n = 6

Output:
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * *
* * * * * *


Your Task:

You don't need to input anything. 

Complete the function printTriangle() 
which takes an integer n  as the input 
parameter and prints the pattern accordingly.


Expected Time Complexity : O(n^2)
Expected Auxilary Space : O(1)


Constraints:
1<= n <= 1000
