Given an array arr[], with 0-based indexing, 
select any two indexes, i and j such that i < j. 

From the subarray arr[i...j], select the smallest 
and second smallest numbers and add them, 
you will get the score for that subarray. 

Return the maximum possible score across all 
the subarrays of array arr[].


Examples :

Input : arr[] = [4, 3, 1, 5, 6]

Output : 11

Explanation : Subarrays with smallest and second smallest are:- [4, 3] smallest = 3,second smallest = 4
[4, 3, 1] smallest = 1, second smallest = 3
[4, 3, 1, 5] smallest = 1, second smallest = 3
[4, 3, 1, 5, 6] smallest = 1, second smallest = 3
[3, 1] smallest = 1, second smallest = 3
[3, 1, 5] smallest = 1, second smallest = 3
[3, 1, 5, 6] smallest = 1, second smallest = 3
[1, 5] smallest = 1, second smallest = 5
[1, 5, 6] smallest = 1, second smallest = 5
[5, 6] smallest = 5, second smallest = 6
Maximum sum among all above choices is, 5 + 6 = 11.


Input : arr[] = [5, 4, 3, 1, 6] 

Output : 9
