Given a sorted array arr[] and a number target, the task 
is to find the upper bound of the target in this given array.

The upper bound of a number is defined as the smallest index 
in the sorted array where the element is greater than the 
given number.

Note: If all the elements in the given array are smaller 
than or equal to the target, the upper bound will be the 
length of the array.


Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 9

Output: 3

Explanation: 3 is the smallest index in arr[], 
at which element (arr[3] = 10) is larger than 9.


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 11

Output: 6

Explanation: 6 is the smallest index in arr[], 
at which element (arr[6] = 25) is larger than 11.


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 100

Output: 7

Explanation: As no element in arr[] is greater 
than 100, return the length of array.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ target ≤ 10^6
