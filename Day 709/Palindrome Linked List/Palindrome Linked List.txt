You are given the head of a singly linked list of positive integers. 

You have to check if the given linked list is palindrome or not.


Examples:

Input:
   
Output: true

Explanation: The given linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1, 
which is a palindrome.


Input:
   
Output: false

Explanation: The given linked list is 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50, 
which is not a palindrome.


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^3
