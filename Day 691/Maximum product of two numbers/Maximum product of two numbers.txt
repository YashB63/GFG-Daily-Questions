Given an array arr of non-negative integers, return 
the maximum product of two numbers possible.


Example:

Input: arr[] = [1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 0] 

Output: 42

Explanation: 6 and 7 have the maximum product.


Input: arr[] = [1, 100, 42, 4, 23]

Output: 4200

Explanation:  42 and 100 have the maximum product.


Constraints:

2 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10^7
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
