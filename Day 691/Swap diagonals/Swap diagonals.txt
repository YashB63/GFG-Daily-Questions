Given a square matrix mat[][], the task is to swap the elements of the major and minor diagonals.



Major Diagonal: Elements that lie from the top-left corner 
to the bottom-right corner of the matrix (i.e., where 
row index equals column index).

Minor Diagonal: Elements that lie from the top-right corner 
to the bottom-left corner (i.e., where the sum of row and 
column indices equals n - 1).


Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[0, 1, 2],
                [3, 4, 5],
                [6, 7, 8]]

Output: [[2, 1, 0],
        [3, 4, 5],
        [8, 7, 6]]

Explanation: Major Diagonal = [0, 4, 8], Minor Diagonal = [2, 4, 6]. 

We are required to swap the diagonal elements of same row, 
thus after doing so, major diagonal will become minor and 
vice-versa. 


Input: mat[][] = [[2, 3],
                [5, 4]]

Output: [[3, 2],
         [4, 5]] 

Explanation: Major Diagonal = [2, 4], Minor Diagonal = [3, 5]. 

We are required to swap the diagonal elements of same row, 
thus after doing so, major diagonal will become minor and 
vice-versa. 


Constraints:

1 ≤ mat.size() ≤ 500
1 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 10^6
