Given an array of positive integers. 

Find the maximum length of Bitonic subsequence. 

A subsequence of array is called Bitonic if it 
is first strictly increasing, then strictly decreasing. 

Return the maximum length of bitonic subsequence.
 
Note : A strictly increasing or a strictly decreasing 
sequence should not be considered as a bitonic sequence


Examples :

Input: n = 5, nums[] = [1, 2, 5, 3, 2]

Output: 5

Explanation: The sequence {1, 2, 5} is increasing and 
the sequence {3, 2} is decreasing so merging both 
we will get length 5.


Input: n = 8, nums[] = [1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1]

Output: 6

Explanation: The bitonic sequence {1, 2, 10, 4, 2, 1} has length 6.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)
 

Constraints:
1 ≤ length of array ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4
