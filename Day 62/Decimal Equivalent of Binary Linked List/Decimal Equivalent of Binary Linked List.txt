Given a singly linked list of length n. 
The link list represents a binary number, 
ie- it contains only 0s and 1s. Find its decimal equivalent.

The significance of the bits decreases 
with the increasing index in the linked list.

An empty linked list is considered 
to represent the decimal value 0. 

Since the answer can be very large, 
answer modulo 109+7 should be printed.


Example 1:
Input:
n = 3
Linked List = {0, 1, 1}
Output:
3
Explanation:
0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 =  1 + 2 + 0 = 3


Example 2:
Input:
n = 4
Linked List = {1, 1, 1, 0}
Output:
14
Explanation:
1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 =  8 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 14

Your Task:
You do not have to take any input or print anything. 
Complete the function decimalValue() which takes a 
head node of a linked list as an input parameter 
and returns decimal representation of it.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
0 <= n <= 100
Data of each node is either 0 or 1
