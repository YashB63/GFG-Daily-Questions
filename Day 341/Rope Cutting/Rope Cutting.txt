You are given array arr of length of ropes. 

A cut operation is performed on ropes such that 
all of them are reduced by the length of the 
smallest rope. 

Return the number of ropes left after every cut 
operation until the length of each rope is zero.


Examples:

Input : arr[] = [5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] 

Output : [4, 3, 2] 

Explanation: In the first operation, 
the minimum ropes are 1 So, we reduce 
length 1 from all of them after reducing 
we left with 4 ropes and we do the same 
for rest. 


Input : arr[] = [5, 1, 6, 9, 8, 11, 2, 2, 6, 5]

Output : [9, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1]

Explanation: In the first operation, 
the minimum ropes are 1 So, we reduce 
length 1 from all of them after reducing 
we left with 9 ropes and so on.


Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
