You have to help a thief to steal as many 
as GoldCoins as possible from a GoldMine. 

There he saw N Gold Boxes an each Gold Boxes 
consists of Ai Plates each plates consists of 
Bi Gold Coins. 

Your task is to print the maximum gold coins 
theif can steal if he can take a maximum of 
T plates.

 
Example 1:

Input:
T = 3, N = 3 
A[] = {1, 2, 3}
B[] = {3, 2, 1}

Output:
7

Explanation:
The thief will take 1 plate of coins
from the first box and 2 plate of coins
from the second plate. 3 + 2*2 = 7.


Example 2:

Input:
T = 0, N = 3 
A[] = {1, 3, 2}
B[] = {2, 3, 1}

Output:
0

Explanation:
The thief can't take any plates.
So he can't steal any coins.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function maxCoins() 
which takes 2 Integers T, and N and two arrays A 
and B of size N as input and returns the maximum 
number of gold coins the thief can steal if he 
can take a maximum of T plates.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N*logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:

0 <= T,N <= 10^4
1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
1 <= B[i] <= 10^4
