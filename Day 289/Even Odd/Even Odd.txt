We've learnt about operators and other basics of CPP. 

Now, it's time to take another leap and learn how to 
use control structures that helps us choose flow of 
any code.

Given two integers a and b. 

Your task is to print the even number first 
and odd number next in individual lines.

Note: Must print end of the line at the end.

Example 1:

Input: a = 2, b = 3 

Output: 2
        3


Example 2:

Input: a = 5, b = 2

Output: 2
        5
