Given a number n, find the minimum number of perfect 
squares (square of an integer) that sum up to n. 


Examples:

Input: n = 100

Output: 1

Explanation: 10 * 10 = 100


Input: n = 6

Output: 3

Explanation = 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 6 


Expected Time Complexity: O(n * sqrt(n))
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^4
