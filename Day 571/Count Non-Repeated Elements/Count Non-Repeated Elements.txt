You are given an array of integers arr[]. 

You need to print the count of non-repeated 
elements in the array.


Example 1:

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Output: 4

Explanation: 4, 5, 6 and 7 are the elements with 
frequency 1 and rest elements are repeated so the 
number of non-repeated elements are 4.


Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]

Output: 3

Explanation: 20, 30, 40 are the elements with 
the frequency 1 and 10 is the repeated element 
to number of non-repeated elements are 3.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^3
0 <= arri <= 10^7
