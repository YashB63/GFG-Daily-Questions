Given a non-negative number n 
and two values l and r. 

The problem is to toggle the bits 
in the range l to r in the binary 
representation of n, i.e., to 
toggle bits from the lth least 
significant bit to the rth least 
significant bit (the rightmost bit 
as counted as the first bit).

A toggle operation flips a bit 
0 to 1 and a bit 1 to 0.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 17 , l = 2 , r = 3

Output:
23

Explanation:
(17)10 = (10001)2.  After toggling all
the bits from 2nd to 3rd position we get
(10111)2 = (23)10


Example 2:

Input:
n = 50 , l = 2 , r = 5

Output:
44

Explanation:
(50)10 = (110010)2.  After toggling all
the bits from 2nd to 5th position we get
(101100)2 = (44)10


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function toggleBits() 
which takes three Integers n, l and r as input and 
returns the modified Integer as the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= l<=r <= Number of Bits in n
