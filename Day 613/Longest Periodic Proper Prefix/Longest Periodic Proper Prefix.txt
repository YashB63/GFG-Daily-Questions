Given a string s, find the length of 
longest periodic proper prefix of s. 

If no such prefix exists, return -1.

A periodic proper prefix is a non empty prefix of s 
(but not the whole string), such that repeating this 
prefix enough times produces a string that starts with 
s.


Examples:

Input: s = "aaaaaa"

Output: 5

Explanation: Repeating the proper prefix "aaaaa" 
forms "aaaaaaaaaa...", which contains "aaaaa" as 
a prefix. 

No longer proper prefix satisfies this.


Input: s = "abcab"

Output: 3

Explanation: Repeating the proper prefix "abc" forms 
"abcabc., which contains "abcab" as a prefix. 

No longer proper prefix satisfies this.


Input: s = "ababd"

Output: -1

Explanation: No proper prefix satisfying the given condition.


Constraints:

1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10^5
s consists of lowercase English alphabets
