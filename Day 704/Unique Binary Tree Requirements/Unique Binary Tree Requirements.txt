Geek wants to know the traversals required 
to construct a unique binary tree. 

Given a pair of traversal, return true if it is 
possible to construct unique binary tree from 
the given traversals otherwise return false.

Each traversal is represented with an integer: 
preorder - 1, inorder - 2, postorder - 3.   


Example 1:

Input:
a = 1, b=2

Output: 1

Explanation: We can construct binary tree using 
inorder traversal and preorder traversal. 


Example 2:

Input: a = 1, b=3

Output: 0 

Explanation: We cannot construct binary tree using 
preorder traversal and postorder traversal. 


Constraints:
1 <= a,b <=3


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isPossible() which takes a and b as input parameters and returns true or false.


Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
