Given a non-empty sequence of characters s, 
return true if sequence is Binary, else 
return false.


Examples:

Input: s = "101"

Output: true

Explanation: Since string contains 
only '0' and '1', output is true.

Input: s = "75"

Output: false

Explanation: Since string contains digits 
other than '0' and '1', output is false.


Constraints:
1 <= s.size() <= 10^5
