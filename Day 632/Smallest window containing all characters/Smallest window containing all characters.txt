Given two strings s and p. Find the smallest 
substring in s consisting of all the 
characters (including duplicates) of the 
string p. 

Return empty string in case no 
such substring is present.

If there are multiple such substring of 
the same length found, return the one 
with the least starting index.


Examples:

Input: s = "timetopractice", p = "toc"

Output: "toprac"

Explanation: "toprac" is the smallest 
substring in which "toc" can be found.


Input: s = "zoomlazapzo", p = "oza"

Output: "apzo"

Explanation: "apzo" is the smallest 
substring in which "oza" can be found.


Input: s = "zoom", p = "zooe"

Output: ""

Explanation: No substring is present 
containing all characters of p.


Constraints: 

1 ≤ s.length(), p.length() ≤ 10^6
s, p consists of lowercase english letters
