Given a number N, count total 
number of divisors of N!.


Example 1:

Input : N = 4

Output: 8

Explaination: 4! is 24. Divisors of 24 are 
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24.


Example 2:

Input : N = 5

Output : 16

Explaination: 5! is 120. Divisors of 120 are 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24 30, 
40, 60 and 120.


Your Task:

You do not need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function totalDivisors() 
which takes N as input parameter and returns total 
number of divisors of N!.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N*logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
