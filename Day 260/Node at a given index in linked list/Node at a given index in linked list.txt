Given the head of a Singly Linked List and an index number k, 
The task is to find the node at the given index (k)(1-based index) 
of the linked list. 

If no such node exists whose index is k then return -1.


Examples :

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7 , k = 3

Output: 3

Explanation: The Node value at index 3 is 3.


Input: LinkedList: 19->28->37->46->55 , k = 6

Output: -1

Explanation: As number of nodes are less 
than k so there is no node at index 6 , 
therefore our answer is -1.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 10^5
1 <= node->data , k <= 10^5
