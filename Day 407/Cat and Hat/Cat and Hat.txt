You are given a string str, 
you need to return True if  
the words "cat" and "hat" 
appear same number of times 
in str, otherwise return False.

Note: str contains only 
lowercase English alphabets.

Constraints:
1 <= str.size() <= 10^5


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
