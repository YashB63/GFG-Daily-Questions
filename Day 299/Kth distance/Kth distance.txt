Given an unsorted array arr. 

Also given the number k which is 
smaller than the size of array. 

Find if the array contains duplicates 
within k distance.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3

Output: false

Explanation: All duplicates are more than k distance away.


Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5] and k = 3

Output: true

Explanation: 1 is repeated at distance 3.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ k < arr.size()
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
