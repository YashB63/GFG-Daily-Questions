Given two integer variables a and b, 
and a boolean variable flag. 

The task is to check the status and return accordingly.

Return True for the following cases:

Either a or b (not both) is non-negative and the flag is false.

Both a and b are negative and the flag is true.

Otherwise, return false.


Example: 

Input:
a = 1
b = -1
flag = False

Output:
True

Explanation:
Since a and b are positive and 
negative respectively and flag
is False, so return True.


Example: 

Input:
a = -182
b = -9121
flag = True

Output:
True

Explanation:
Since a and b are negative and 
negative respectively and flag
is True, so return True.


Your Task:

This is a function problem. 

Complete the function checkStatus() and 
return True or False according to the parameters.


Constraints:
-10^6 <= a, b <= 10^6


Expected time complexity: O(1)
Expected auxiliary space: O(1)
