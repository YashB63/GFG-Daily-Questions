Given an unsorted array arr. 

Find all the star elements in the array. 

Star elements are those elements that are 
strictly greater than all the elements on 
its right side.

Note: Assume the first element is greater than all 
the elements on its left side and the last element 
is greater than all the elements on its right side.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Output: [8, 4, 3, 2, 1] 

Explanation: Star elements are 8, 4, 3, 2 and 1.


Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 10, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 4]

Output: [10, 4] 

Explanation: Star elements are 10 and 4.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 10^6
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
