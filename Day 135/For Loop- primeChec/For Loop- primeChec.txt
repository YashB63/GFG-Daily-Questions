What do you do when you need to execute 
certain statements more than once? 

You put them in a loop. 

Loops are very powerful. 

Majority of coding questions 
need loops to work. 

You can't even input testcases without loops!

Here, we will use for loop and check 
if the given number n is prime or not.

Note: A number is prime if it's divisible ONLY 
by itself and 1 and not any other number. 

Also, 1 is not prime.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 1

Output:No

Explanation: it is already said 
that 1 is not a prime number.


Example 2:

Input:
n = 2

Output:Yes

Explanation: 2 is a prime number because 
it is only divisible by itself and 1.

User Task:
Your task is to complete the provided 
function isPrime() which should return 
a string "Yes" if n is prime and "No" if not.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
