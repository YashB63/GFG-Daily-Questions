Given a string S which contains only small letters. 

The task is to make a square matrix from string S. 

Then perform the following operations.

1. In each column delete the characters which occur more than one.

2. Let the characters in order be abcd....wxyz 
then print them in order azbycxdw....  

For example, after operation 1 if the remaining 
characters in a column are cedjki then after 
sorting they become cdeijk , now when printed 
in the given order the output will be ckdjei. 

If there's no character remaining Print 0.

Note: Length of the Input String 
is always a Perfect Square.

 
Example 1:

Input:
S = "adgkbdhlceilcfjm"

Output:
abefgjhikm

Explanation:
Matrix will be
a d g k
b d h l
c e i  l
c f  j m
In 1st column 'c', in 2nd column 'd' and in
4th column 'l' has occurred more than once.
So after deleting them and sorting the
remaining characters the matrix become 

   a - g  k
   b - h  -
   - e i   -
   - f  j  m 

So after operation 2 we get 'ab' from 1st
column, 'ef' from 2nd column, 'gjhi' from
3rd column and 'km' from 4th column. Appending
all of them we get the output as  "abefgjhikm".


Example 2:

Input:
S = "abcabcabc"

Output:
0

Explanation:
Matrix will be
a b c
a b c
a b c
So, There will be no letters remaining
and the output will be 0. 
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function matrixGame() 
which takes a String S and returns the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)

 
Constraints

1 <= |S| <= 10^5
