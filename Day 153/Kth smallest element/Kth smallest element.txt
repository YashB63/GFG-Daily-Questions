Given an array arr[] and an integer k 
where k is smaller than the size of the array, 
the task is to find the kth smallest element 
in the given array. 

It is given that all array elements are distinct.

Note:-  l and r denotes the starting and 
ending index of the array.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
arr[] = 7 10 4 3 20 15
k = 3
l=0 r=5

Output : 
7

Explanation :
3rd smallest element in the given 
array is 7.


Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
arr[] = 7 10 4 20 15
k = 4 
l=0 r=4

Output : 
15

Explanation :
4th smallest element in the given 
array is 15.


Your Task:

You don't have to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function kthSmallest() 
which takes the array arr[], integers l and r 
denoting the starting and ending index of the 
array and an integer k as input and 
returns the kth smallest element.
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(n*log(n) )
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(log(n))
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
l = 0
r = N-1
1<= arr[i] <= 10^5
1 <= k <= n
