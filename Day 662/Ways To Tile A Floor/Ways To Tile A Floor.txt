Given a floor of dimensions 2 x n and tiles of 
dimensions 2 x 1, the task is to find the 
number of ways the floor can be tiled. 

A tile can either be placed horizontally i.e as 
a 1 x 2 tile or vertically i.e as 2 x 1 tile. 


Examples :

Input: n = 3

Output: 3

Explanation: We need 3 tiles to tile the boardof size  2 x 3.
 
We can tile in following ways:

1) Place all 3 tiles vertically. 

2) Place first tile verticallyand remaining 2 tiles horizontally.

3) Place first 2 tiles horizontally and remaining tiles vertically.


Input: n = 4

Output: 5

Explanation: For a 2 x 4 board, there are 5 ways
1) All 4 vertical
2) All 4 horizontal
3) First 2 vertical, remaining 2 horizontal.
4) First 2 horizontal, remaining2 vertical.
5) Corner 2 vertical, middle 2 horizontal.


Input: n = 2

Output: 2


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
