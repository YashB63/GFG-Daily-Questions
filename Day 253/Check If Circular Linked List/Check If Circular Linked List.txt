Given the head, the head of a singly linked list, 
find if the linked list is circular or not. 

A linked list is called circular if it is not NULL 
terminated and all nodes are connected in the form of a cycle. 

An empty linked list is considered circular.

Note: The linked list does not contain any inner loop.


Examples:

Note: In the input format, k = 1 indicates 
the presence of a cycle; otherwise, k = 0, 
followed by the linked list values on a new line.


Input: k=1, LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5

Output: true

Explanation: As shown in figure the first and 
last node is connected, i.e. 5 --> 2


Input: k=0, LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1
 
Output: false

Explanation: As shown in figure this 
is not a circular linked list.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
0 <= number of nodes <= 100
1 <= node -> data <= 10^4
