Given an integer array of size n and a non-negative integer k, 
count all distinct pairs with a difference equal to k, i.e., 
A[ i ] - A[ j ] = k.
 

Example 1:

Input: array = {1, 5, 4, 1, 2}, k = 0

Output: 1

Explanation: There is only one pair (1, 1) 
whose difference equal to 0.


Example 2:

Input: array = {1, 5, 3}, k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: There are two pairs (5, 3) 
and (1, 3) whose difference equal to 2.


Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function TotalPairs() 
which takes array and k as input parameters and 
returns the count of all distinct pairs.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)


Constraints:

2 <= n <= 10^4
0 <= k <= 10^4
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
