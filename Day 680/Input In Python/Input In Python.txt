You need to perform three separate tasks based 
on the given input:

String Input and Print: Take a text input as a 
string and print it as it is.

Integer Input and Add: Take an integer input n, 
add 10 to it, and print the result.

Float Input and Multiply: Take a floating-point 
number as input, multiply it by 10, and print 
the result.


Examples:

Input: s = "Hello", n = 20, f = 5.5

Output: 
Hello
30
55.0

Explanation: 
The string Hello is printed as it is.

The integer 20 is increased by 10 and results in 30.

The floating-point number 5.5 is multiplied by 10 
and results in 55.0.
