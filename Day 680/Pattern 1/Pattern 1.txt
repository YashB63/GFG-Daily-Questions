Geek is very fond of patterns. 

Once, his teacher gave him a square pattern to solve. 

He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a square pattern with the help of *  
such that each * is space-separated in each line.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 3

Output:
* * *
* * *
* * *


Example 2:

Input:
n = 5

Output:
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *

Your Task: You don't need to input anything. 

Complete the function printSquare() which takes  
an integer n  as the input parameter and print 
the pattern.


Time Complexity : O(n^2)
Space Complexity : O(1)


Constraints:
1<= n <= 1000
