You are given a string s, and a list of jumps[][] 
of size n, where each jumps[i] = [s1, s2] denotes 
that you are allowed to jump from character s1 to 
s2 in the forward direction.

Additionally, you are allowed to jump 
forward from a character to any other 
occurrence of the same character 
within the string.

You start at index 0 of the string. 

After every valid jump from index i to 
index j, where s[i] = s1 and s[j] = s2, 
you earn a score equal to the sum of 
ASCII values of all characters between 
the jump except for the characters 
equals s2, i.e.

score(i, j) = sum(ascii(s[k]) for i ≤ k < j 
and s[k] != s[j]).

Determine the maximum score that can be achieved by 
performing a sequence of valid jumps starting from 
index 0.


Examples:

Input: s = "forgfg", jumps[][] = [['f', 'r'], ['r', 'g']]

Output: 429

Explanation: We can jump from 'f' to 'r' at 
index 2, this will gives a score equals to 
sum of ASCII value of 'f', 'o' i.e. 213.

Now we can jump from 'r' to 'g' at index 5, 
this will gives a score equals to sum of 
ASCII value of 'r', 'f' i.e. 216.

Hence maximum total score obtain will be 429. 


Input: s = "abcda", jumps[][] = [[b, d]]

Output: 297

Explanation: We can jump from 'a' to 'a'
(as both are same character) at index 4, 
this will gives a score equals to sum of 
ASCII value of 'b', 'c', 'd' i.e. 297.

Hence maximum total score obtain will be 297. 


Constraints:

1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 * 10^5
1 ≤ jumps.size() ≤ 676
There are atleast two distinct characters in s.
