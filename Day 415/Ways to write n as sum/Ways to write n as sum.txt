Given a positive integer n, the task is 
to find the number of different ways in 
which n can be written as a sum of two 
or more positive integers. 

Return the answer with the modulo 10^9+7.


Examples:

Input: n = 5

Output: 6

Explanation: 1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+2, 1+1+3, 1+4, 
2+1+2 and 2+3. 

So, a total of 6 ways.


Input: n = 3

Output: 2

Explanation: 1+1+1 and 1+2.  

So, a total of 2 ways.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^3
