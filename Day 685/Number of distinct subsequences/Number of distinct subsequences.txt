Given a string str consisting of 
lowercase english alphabets, the 
task is to find the number of 
distinct subsequences of the 
string

Note: Answer can be very large, so, 
ouput will be answer modulo 10^9+7.


Examples:

Input: str = "gfg"

Output: 7

Explanation: 
The seven distinct subsequences are "", 
"g", "f", "gf", "fg", "gg" and "gfg" .


Input: str = "ggg"

Output: 4

The four distinct subsequences 
are "", "g", "gg", "ggg".


Constraints:

1 ≤ |str| ≤ 10^5
str contains lower case English alphabets
