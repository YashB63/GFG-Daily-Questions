You are given n balls numbered from 1 to n and there 
are n baskets numbered from 1 to n in front of you. 

The ith basket is meant for the ith ball. 

Calculate the number of ways in which no 
ball goes into its respective basket.

Note: The answer will always fit into a 32-bit integer.


Examples:

Input: n = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: For two balls {1, 2}, there 
is only one possible derangement {2, 1}.


Input: n = 3

Output: 2

Explanation: For three balls {1, 2, 3}, 
there are two possible derangements 
{3, 1, 2} and {2, 3, 1}.


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 12
