Given the head of a doubly-linked list, 
a position p, and an integer x. 

Add a new node with value x at the position 
just after pth node in the doubly linked 
list and return the head of the updated list.

Note: The position is 0-based indexed.


Examples:

Input: p = 2, x = 6

Output: 2 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6

Explanation: Insert a node of 
value 6 after the 2nd node.


Input: p = 0, x = 44 

Output: 1 <-> 44 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4

Explanation: Insert a node of 
value 44 after the 0th node.


Constraints:

0 ≤ p < list size ≤ 10^4
0 ≤ x, node->data ≤ 10^4
