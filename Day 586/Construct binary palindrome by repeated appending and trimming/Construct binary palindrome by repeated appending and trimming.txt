You are given two integers n and k. 

Your task is to create a palindrome of 
length n using binary numbers (0s and 1s) 
of length k that starts with 1. 

You can repeat the binary number as many 
times as you need, and you are allowed to 
remove any zeros from the end of the final 
palindrome.

The palindrome must always start with 1 and 
should have as many zeros as possible. 

If it is not possible to create such a 
palindrome of length n using any binary 
number of length k, return -1.


Examples:

Input: n = 5, k = 3

Output: 11011

Explanation: Since only length of 3 binary 
digits are allowed, so the possible binary 
representations are 100, 110, 111, 101. 

Out of these, If we take the binary 
representation of 6(110), combine it 
twice & trim a zero the final output 
will be 11011, which satisfy all the 
conditions


Input: n = 6, k = 1

Output: 111111

Explanation: 
The binary representation of 1 is 1 of 
length 1, it is combined six times to 
produce 111111.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^6
