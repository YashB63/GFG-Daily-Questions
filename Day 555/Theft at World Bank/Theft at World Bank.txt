The worlds most successful thief Albert 
Spaggiari was planning for his next 
heist on the world bank. 

He decides to carry a sack with him, 
which can carry a maximum weight of 
c kgs. 

Inside the world bank there were n 
large blocks of gold. 

All the blocks have some profit value 
associated with them i.e. if he steals 
ith block of weight w[i] then he will 
have p[i] profit. 

As blocks were heavy he decided to 
steal some part of them by cutting 
them with his cutter.

The thief does not like symmetry, 
hence, he wishes to not take blocks 
or parts of them whose weight is a 
perfect square. 

Now, you need to find out the maximum 
profit that he can earn given that 
he can only carry blocks of gold in 
his sack. 

Note: The answer should be precise 
upto 3 decimal places.

 
Examples :

n = 3, c = 10, w[] = {4, 5, 7}, p[] = {8, 5, 4)

Output: 
7.857

Explanation: As first blocks weight is 4 
which is a perfect square, he will not 
use this block. 

Now with the remaining blocks the most 
optimal way is to use 2nd block 
completely and cut 5kg piece from the 
3rd block to get a total profit of 5 + 
2.857 = 7.857
