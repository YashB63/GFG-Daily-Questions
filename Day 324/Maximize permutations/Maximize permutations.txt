Given two numbers N and M. Construct maximal 
number by permuting (changing order) the 
digits of N, not exceeding M.

It is allowed to leave N as it is. 

If there's no Permutation of digits 
of N which doesn't exceed M, then 
print -1.

Note : Answer shouldn't have any leading zeroes.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 123
M = 222

Output:
213

Explanation: There are total 3! permutations 
possible for N = 123, but the only permutation 
that satisfies the given condition is 213.


Example 2:

Input:
N =  3921
M = 10000

Output:
9321

Explanation: Among all the Possible Permutations,
9321 is Maximum.


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function maxPerm() 
which takes two Integers N and M as input 
parameters and returns the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|N|2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|N|)


Constraints:

1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^7
