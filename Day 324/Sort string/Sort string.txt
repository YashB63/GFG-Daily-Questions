Given a string S, sort it in the following manner. 

Sorted string must contain a vowel as first letter 
and a consonant as next letter and so on OR a 
consonant as first letter and a vowel as next 
letter and so on, depending on the string. 

If there is no vowel left then print the 
remaining consonant in ascending order 
and vice versa. 

Note: Order of vowel must be a->e->i->o->u and 
order of consonant must be b->c->d... and so on.


Example 1:

Input: abcdei 

Output: abecid 

Explanation: 'a' (Vowel) came first so the
pattern of sorted string is vcvcvcvc... 


Example 2:

Input: bcadefgh

Output: bacedfgh 

Explanation: 'b' (consonant) came first so
the pattern of sorted string is cvcvcvcv....
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function SortedString() 
which takes the string s as input parameters and 
returns the sorted string.
