Here we'll talk about the novel and 
perhaps tantalizing concept of slicing. 

Slicing is the process through which you 
can extract some continuous part of a string. 

For example: string is "python", 
let's use slicing in this. 

Slicing can be done as:

a. string[0:2] = py (Slicing till index 1)
b. string[0:] = python (Slicing till last index)
c. string[0:4] = pyth (Slicing till index 3)
d. string[0:-2] = pyth (Slicing till index -3).
Note: -1 indexing starts from last of any string.

Now, lets look into this through a question. 

Given a string of braces named bound_by, 
and a string named tag_name. 

The task is to print a new string such that 
tag_name is in the middle of bound_by.


Example 1:

Input: 
bound_by = [[]], tag_name = tag
Output:
[[tag]]


Example 2:

Input: 
bound_by = <>, tag_name = body

Output:
<body>


Your Task:

Your task is to complete the function join_middle() 
which should return the modified string.


Constraints:
1 <= |tag_name| <= 10^3
