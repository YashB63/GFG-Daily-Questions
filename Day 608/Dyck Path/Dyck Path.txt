Consider a N x N grid with indexes of top left corner as (0, 0). 

Dyck path is a staircase walk from bottom left, i.e., (N-1, 0) 
to top right, i.e., (0, N-1) that lies above the diagonal cells 
(or cells on line from bottom left to top right).

The task is to count the number of Dyck 
Paths from (N-1, 0) to (0, N-1).

Here are the some of the possible paths 
for different N.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 4

Output:
14 

Explanation:
Refer to the diagram above.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 3

Output:
5

Explanation:
Refer to the diagram above.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function dyckPaths() 
which takes an Integer N as input and returns the 
answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 30
