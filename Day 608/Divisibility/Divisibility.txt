Given an array nums[] of n elements and a number k. 

Your task is to count the number of integers from 1 
to k which are divisible by atleast one of the 
elements of nums[].
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = {2, 3}, k = 10

Output: 7

Explanation: The numbers from 1 to 10
which are divisible by either 2 or 3
are - 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10


Example 2:

Input: nums = {2}, k = 5

Output: 2

Explanation: The numbers which are divisble 
by 2 from 1 to 5 are 2 and 4.
 

Your Task:

You don't have to read or print anyhting. 

Your task is to complete the function Count() 
which takes nums and k as input parameter and 
returns count of integers from 1 to k which 
are divisible by atleast one of the element 
of nums[].
 

Expected Time Compelxity: O(n * 2^n * log(k))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 12
1 <= k <= 10^18
1 <= nums[i] <= 20
