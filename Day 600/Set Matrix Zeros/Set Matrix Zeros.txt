You are given a 2D matrix mat[][] of size n x m. 

The task is to modify the matrix such that if 
mat[i][j] is 0, all the elements in the i-th 
row and j-th column are set to 0.


Examples:

Input: 
    
Output: 
    
Explanation: mat[1][1] = 0, so all elements 
in row 1 and column 1 are updated to zeroes.


Input: 
    
Output: 
    
Explanation: mat[0][0] and mat[0][3] are 0s, 
so all elements in row 0, column 0 and column 
3 are updated to zeroes.


Constraints:

1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500
- 2^31 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 2^31 - 1
