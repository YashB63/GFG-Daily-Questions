Given a pair of strings s1 and s2 of equal 
lengths, your task is to find which of the 
two strings has more distinct subsequences. 

If both strings have the same number 
of distinct subsequences, return s1.


Examples:

Input: s1 = "gfg", s2 = "ggg"

Output: "gfg"

Explanation: "gfg" have 6 distinct subsequences 
whereas "ggg" have 3 distinct subsequences. 


Input: s1 = "a", s2 = "b"

Output: "a"

Explanation: Both the strings have 
only 1 distinct subsequence.
