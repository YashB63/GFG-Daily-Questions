Given a string S of lowercase english alphabetic 
characters and a substring range starting from 
q1 and ending at q2, the task is to find out the 
count of palindromic substrings in the given 
substring range.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 7 
S = "xyaabax"
q1 = 3
q2 = 5

Output: 4

Explanation: The substring in the given range 
is "aba". Hence, the palindromic substrings are:
"a", "b", "a" and "aba".


Example 2:

Input: 
N = 7
S = "xyaabax" 
q1 = 2 
q2 = 3. 

Output: 3

Explanation: The substring in the given range
is "aa". Hence, the palindromic substrings are: 
"a", "a" and "aa".


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
countPalinInRange() which takes the 
string S, its length N and the range 
variables q1 and q2 as input parameters 
and returns the count of the Palindromic 
substrings in the given substring range.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|2).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000
0 ≤ q1, q2 < |S|
