Given a graph with n vertices, e edges 
and an array arr[] denoting the edges 
connected to each other, check whether 
it is Biconnected or not.

Note: The given graph is Undirected.

 
Examples :

Input: n = 2, e = 1, arr = {0, 1}

Output: 1

Explanation:
       0
      /
     1
The above graph is Biconnected.


Input: n = 3, e = 2, arr = {0, 1, 1, 2}

Output: 0

Explanation:
       0
      /
     1
      \
       2
The above graph is not Biconnected.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n+e)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

 
Constraints:

1 <= e <= 100
2 <= n <= 100
