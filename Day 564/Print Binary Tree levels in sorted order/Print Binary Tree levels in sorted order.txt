Given an array arr[] which contains data 
of N nodes of Complete Binary tree in 
level order fashion. 

The task is to print the level 
order traversal in sorted order.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
arr[] = {7 6 5 4 3 2 1}

Output:
7
5 6
1 2 3 4

Explanation: The formed Binary Tree is:
             7
          /      \
        6         5
      /  \      /   \
     4    3    2     1


Example 2:

Input:
N = 6
arr[] = {5 6 4 9 2 1}

Output:
5
4 6
1 2 9

Explanation: The formed Binary Tree is:
             5
          /     \
        6        4
      /  \      /    
     9    2    1    


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
binTreeSortedLevels() which takes the 
array arr[] and its size N as inputs 
and returns a 2D array where the i-th 
array denotes the nodes of the i-th 
level in sorted order.


Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^4
