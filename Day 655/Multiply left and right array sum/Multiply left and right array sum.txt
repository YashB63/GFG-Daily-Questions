You are given an array of integers, your task is 
to divide the array into two sub-arrays 
(left and right) containing half of the array 
elements. 

Find the sum of the subarrays and then return 
the multiply of both the subarrays.

Note: If the length of the array is odd then the 
right half will contain one element more than 
the left half.


Examples :

Input : arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output : 21

Explanation: Sum up an array from index 0 to 
1 = 3, Sum up an array from index 2 to 3 = 7. 

Their multiplication is 21.


Input : arr = [1, 2] 

Output :  2 

Explanation: Their multiplication is 1*2 is equal to 2.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1000
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 100
