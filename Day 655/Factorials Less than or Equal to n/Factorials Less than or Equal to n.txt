A number n is called a factorial number if 
it is the factorial of a positive integer. 

For example, the first few factorial numbers 
are 1, 2, 6, 24, 120,

Given a number n, the task is to return the 
list/vector of the factorial numbers smaller 
than or equal to n.


Examples:

Input: n = 3

Output: 1 2

Explanation: The first factorial number 
is 1 which is less than equal to n. 

The second number is 2 which is less than 
equal to n,but the third factorial number 
is 6 which is greater than n. So we print 
only 1 and 2.


Input: n = 6

Output: 1 2 6

Explanation: The first three factorial numbers 
are less than equal to n but the fourth 
factorial number 24 is greater than n. 

So we print only first three factorial numbers.


Constraints:
1<=n<=10^18
