Given an integer s, write a program to print 
the square of size s using "*" character. 

Note: Make sure to add a " " between two "*". 

Add a new line after printing the square


Examples :

Input: s = 4

Output:
* * * *
*     *
*     *
* * * *

Explanation: It's a square! Each side contains s = 4 *.


Input: s = 3

Output:
* * * 
*   *
* * *

Explanation: It's a square! Each side contains s = 3 *.


Constraints:
1 ≤ s ≤ 10


Expected Complexities

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
