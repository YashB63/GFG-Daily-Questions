A given series 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, 17, 21, 27, 29, ... and so on. 

You need to identify the pattern and determine 
whether the input number ( n ) is a part of 
the given series or not. 

If yes then return "Yes", otherwise "No".


Example 1:

Input: n = 9

Output: Yes

Explanation: 9 is the part of
the sequence.


Example 2:

Input: n = 8

Output: No

Explanation: 8 is not the part
of the sequence


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function isPart() 
which takes n as inputs and returns the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
