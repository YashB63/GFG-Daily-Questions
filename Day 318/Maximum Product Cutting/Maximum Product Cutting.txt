Given a rope of length N meters, 
cut the rope in different parts 
of integer lengths in a way that 
maximizes the product of lengths 
of all parts. 

You must make at least one cut. 

Assume that the length of the rope 
is more than one meter.


Example 1:

Input: N = 5

Output: 6

Explanation: Maximum obtainable product 
is 2*3


Example 2:

Input: N = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: Maximum obtainable product
is 1*1


Your Task: 
 
You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function maxProduct() which takes N 
as input parameter and returns the maximum product.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:

2 ≤ N ≤ 50
