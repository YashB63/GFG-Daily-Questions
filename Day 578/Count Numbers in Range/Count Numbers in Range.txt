Given two positive integers L and R, 
return count of numbers having exactly 
3 divisors from L to R inclusive.

 
Example 1:

Input:
L = 1, R = 10

Output:
2

Explanation:
4 and 9 are two numbers between 1 and 10
and have exactly 3 divisors.


Example 2:

Input:
L = 2, R = 5

Output:
1

Explanation:
4 is the only number between 2 and 5
and have exactly 3 divisors.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
count3DivNums() which takes 2 Integers 
L, and R as input and returns the count 
of numbers between L and R having exacly 
3 divisors.

 
Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(R)*log(R))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(sqrt(R))


Constraints:
1 <= L <= R <= 10^9
