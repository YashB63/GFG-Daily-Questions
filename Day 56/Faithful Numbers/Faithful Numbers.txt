A number is called faithful if you can write it 
as the sum of distinct powers of 7. 

e.g.,  2457 = 7 + 7^2 + 7^4 . 
If we order all the faithful numbers, 
we get the sequence 1 = 7^0, 7 = 7^1, 
8 = 7^0 + 7^1, 49 = 7^2, 50 = 7^0 + 7^2 . . . and so on.

Given some value of N, 
you have to find the N'th faithful number.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
Output:
8
Explanation:
8 is the 3rd Faithful number.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 7
Output:
57
Explanation:
57 is the 7th Faithful number.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function nthFaithfulNum() 
which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(log(N))

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
