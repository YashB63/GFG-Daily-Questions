You are given a set of some types of rectangular 3-D boxes, 
where the ith box has height, width, and length height[i], 
width[i], and length[i] respectively. 

You have to create a stack of boxes which is as tall as possible, 
but you can only stack a box on top of another box if the 
dimensions of the 2-D base of the lower box are each strictly 
larger than those of the 2-D base of the higher box. 

Of course, you can rotate a box so that any side 
functions as its base. 

It is also allowable to use multiple instances of the 
same type of box. 

Your task is to complete the function maxHeight which returns 
the height of the highest possible stack so formed.

Note: Base of the lower box should be strictly larger 
than that of the new box we're going to place. 

This is in terms of both length and width, 
not just in terms of area. 

So, two boxes with same base cannot be placed 
one over the other.


Examples:

Input: height[] = [4, 1, 4, 10], width[] = [6, 2, 5, 12], length[] = [7, 3, 6, 32]

Output: 60

Explanation: One way of placing the boxes is as 
follows in the bottom to top manner: 
(Denoting the boxes in (l, w, h) manner)(12, 32, 10) 
(10, 12, 32) (6, 7, 4) (5, 6, 4) (4, 5, 6) (2, 3, 1) 
(1, 2, 3) Hence, the total height of this stack is 
10 + 32 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 3 = 60. 

No other combination of boxes produces a height greater than this.


Input: height[] = [1, 4, 3], width[] = [2, 5, 4], length[] = [3, 6, 1]

Output: 15

Explanation: One way of placing the boxes is as follows 
in the bottom to top manner: (Denoting the boxes in 
(l, w, h) manner)(5, 6, 4) (4, 5, 6) (3, 4, 1), (2, 3, 1) 
(1, 2, 3).

Hence, the total height of this stack is 4 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 15 
No other combination of boxes produces a height greater than this.


Input: height[] = [3], width[] = [2], length[] = [6]

Output: 8

Explanation: One way of placing the boxes is as 
follows in the bottom to top manner: 
(Denoting the boxes in (l, w, h) manner)(6, 3, 2) 
(3, 2, 6). 

Hence, the total height of this stack is 2 + 6 = 8. 

No other combination of boxes produces a height 
greater than this.


Constraints:

1  ≤  number of boxes  ≤  100
1  ≤  height[i],width[i],length[i]  ≤  100
