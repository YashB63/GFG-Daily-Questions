You are given a number n. 

You need to find the nth Fibonacci number.

Note: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) ; 
where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1


Example:

Input: n = 3

Output: 2

Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence starts as 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5... The 3rd Fibonacci number 
is 2.


Input: n = 5

Output: 5

Explanation: The sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5... 
The 5th Fibonacci number is 5.


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 20
