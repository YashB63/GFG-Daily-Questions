Given a doubly linked list, rotate the 
linked list counter-clockwise by P nodes. 

Here P is a given positive integer and is smaller 
than the count of nodes(N) in a linked list.


Example 1:

Input: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6 , P = 2

Output: 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 1 <-> 2

Explanation: Doubly linked list after rotating
2 nodes is: 3 4 5 6 1 2.


Example 2:

Input: 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 1 ,P = 3

Output: 1<-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function rotateDLL() 
which takes head node of the linked list and an 
integer P as input parameters and returns the head 
node after rotating the linked list by P nodes.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

2 <= N <= 100
1 <= P <  N
