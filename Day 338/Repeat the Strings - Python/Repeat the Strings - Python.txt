Whooaah! Your are now familiar with String slicing. 

Let's have one more question to make it crystal 
clear for you with some conditional statements.

Given two strings a and b. The task is to make a 
new string where the string with longer length 
should be in between and the one with shorter 
length should be outside on front and end. 

New string should be like shorter+longer+shorter.


Example:

Input: 
a = Hi, b = There

Output: 
HiThereHi

Explanation: 
After joining short+long+short strings, 
we have new string as "HiThereHi".


Your Task:

Your task is to complete the function combo_string(), 
which joins short+long+short strings and returns the 
new concatenated string..


Constraints:

1 <= |a, b| <= 10^3
