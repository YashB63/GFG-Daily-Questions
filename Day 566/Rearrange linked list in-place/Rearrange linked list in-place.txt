Given a singly linked list L0 -> L1 -> â€¦ -> Ln-1 -> Ln. 

Rearrange the nodes in the list so that the 
newly formed list is: L0 -> Ln -> L1 -> Ln-1 
-> L2 -> Ln-2.


Examples :

Input: LinkedList : 1->2->3->4

Output: 1->4->2->3

Explanation: After rearranging the linked 
list as required, we have 1, 4, 2 and 3 
as the elements of the linked list.


Input: LinkedList : 1->2->3->4->5

Output: 1->5->2->4->3


Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes <= 10^5
1 <= node->data <= 10^3
