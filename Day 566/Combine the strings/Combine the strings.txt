Given an array s containing n strings, 
find the max length of the string 
obtained by combining the strings. 

Two strings can be combined only if the 
last character of the first string and 
the first character of the second 
string are the same.

Note: If no two strings can 
be combined then return 0.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 3
s[] = {"RBR", "BBR", "RRR"}

Output: 9

Explanation: Combined string can 
             be: BBR + RBR + RRR


Example 2:

Input:
n = 2
s[] = {"RRR", "BBB"}

Output: 0

Explanation: Since combining condition
             isn't fulfilled answer is 0.


Your Task:

Your task is to complete the function combine() 
which takes 2 arguments(integer n and array of 
n strings) and returns the maximum length of 
combined strings possible. 

If no 2 strings can be combined return 0. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

2<=n<=10^4
1<=|si|<=100, where 0<=i<n
s will only contain {R,B}
