Given an array arr[] (may contain duplicates) 
and a positive integer k, your task is to count 
the number of elements whose occurrence is exactly 
equal to the size of array arr[] divided by k times.


Examples:

Input: k = 2, arr[] = [1, 4, 1, 2, 4]

Output: 2

Explanation:In the given array, 1 and 4 
occurs floor(5/2) = 2 times.So count is 2.


Input: k = 4, arr[] = [1, 1, 7, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: In the given array, only 7 occurs floor(4/4) = 1 times.So count is 1.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n). 
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).


Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5
1 <= arri <= 10^6
1 <= k <= arr.size()
