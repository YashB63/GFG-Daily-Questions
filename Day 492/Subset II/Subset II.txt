You are given an integer array nums 
that may contain duplicates. 

Your task is to return all possible subsets. 

Return only unique subsets and 
they can be in any order.

Note: The individual subsets should be sorted.


Example:

Input: 
nums = [1,2,2] 

Output: 
[[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]

Explanation: 
We can have subsets ranging from length 0 to 3. 

which are listed above. 

Also the subset [1,2] appears twice but is printed 
only once as we require only unique subsets.


Your Task:

Complete the function vector> printUniqueSubset(), 
which takes  a vector nums and return a vector of 
vector consisting of all unique subsets.


Expected Time Complexity: O(2N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(2N).


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
