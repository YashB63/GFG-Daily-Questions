Find the number of days required to reach 
the top of the staircase of Q stairs if 
one moves R stairs upwards during daytime 
and S stairs downwards during night.


Example 1:

Input:
R = 5, S = 1, Q = 6

Output:
2

Explanation:
After end of whole first day he will
end up at Stair number 4. Then the next
day, he will reach the top by climbing 2
more stairs.


Example 2:

Input:
R = 2, S = 1, Q = 3

Output:
2

Explanation:
After end of whole first day he will
end up at Stair number 1. Then the next
day, he will reach the top by climbing 2
more stairs.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function noOfDays() 
which takes 3 Integers R,S and Q as input and 
returns the answer.

 
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= S < R <= Q <= 10^9
