Given an array arr of positive sorted integers. 

The task is to find the closest value to the 
given number k in array. 

Array may contain duplicate values.

Note: If the difference is same for two values 
print the value which is greater than the given number.


Example 1:

Input : 
n = 4
k = 4
arr[] = {1, 3, 6, 7}

Output : 3

Explanation:
We have an array [1, 3, 6, 7] and target is 4.

If we look at the absolute difference of target 
with every element of an array we will get 
[ |1-4|, |3-4|, |6-4|, |7-4| ]. So, the closest number is 3.
Example 2:

Input :
n = 7
k = 4
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Output : 5

Explanation: as we can see the absolute difference 
of 4 is same from 3 and 5 so we have to 
return greater number, which is 5.


Your Task:
This is a function problem. 
The input is already taken care 
of by the driver code. 

You only need to complete the function 
findClosest() that takes integer n ,
integer k  and an sorted array arr of 
size n as input parameters and return 
the closest number of the target in an array. 

The driver code takes care of the printing.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(n)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
