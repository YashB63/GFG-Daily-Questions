Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, 
find the index (0-based) of the smallest 
element in arr[] that is greater than or 
equal to x.
 
This element is called the ceil of x. 

If such an element does not exist, return -1.

Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, 
return the index of the first occurrence.


Examples

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 5

Output: 2

Explanation: Smallest number greater than 5 is 8, 
whose index is 2.


Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 20

Output: -1

Explanation: No element greater than 20 is found. 
So output is -1.


Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 0

Output: 0

Explanation: Smallest number greater than 0 is 1, 
whose indices are 0 and 1. 

The index of the first occurrence is 0.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ x ≤ arr[n-1]
