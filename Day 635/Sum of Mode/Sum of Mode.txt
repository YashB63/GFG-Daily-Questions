Given an array arr[] of positive integers and an integer k. 

You have to find the sum of the modes 
of all the subarrays of size k.

Note: The mode of a subarray is the 
element that occurs with the highest 
frequency. 

If multiple elements have the same highest frequency, 
the smallest such element is considered the mode.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 4, 4], k = 3

Output: 13

Explanation: The mode of each k size subarray is 
[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4] and sum of all modes is 13.


Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 3, 5], k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation: The mode of each k size 
subarray is [1, 1, 1, 3] and sum of 
all modes is 6.


Constraints:

1 ≤ k ≤ arr.size() ≤10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
