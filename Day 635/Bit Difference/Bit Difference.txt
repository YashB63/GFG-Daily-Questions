You are given two numbers a and b. 

The task is to count the number of 
bits needed to be flipped to convert 
a to b.

Note : flipping of bit means inverting 
its value -- changing 1 to 0 and 0 to 1


Examples:

Input: a = 10, b = 20

Output: 4

Explanation: a  = 01010, b  = 10100, As we 
can see, the bits of A that need to be 
flipped are 01010. 

If we flip these bits, we get 10100, 
which is B.


Input: a = 20, b = 25

Output: 3

Explanation: a  = 10100, b  = 11001, As we 
can see, the bits of A that need to be 
flipped are 10100. 

If we flip these bits, we get 11001, 
which is B.


Constraints: 
1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6
