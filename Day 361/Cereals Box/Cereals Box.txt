You are given N numbers you can decrease each 
number by 10 % or K kg whichever is more. 

If the number you choose is less 
than K you can make it zero. 

Your task is to minimize the sum of 
the number as small as possible by 
performing N operations only.

Note: Final answer should be typecasted to the 
nearest integer smaller or equal to the value.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
k = 10
arr = 100 15

Output:
95

Explanation:
You will remove 10 from 100
then once again remove 10 
90.


Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
K = 10
arr = 90 100

Output
170

Explanation:
remove 10 each time
from either 100 or 90.


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function minSum() 
which takes an array of integer, its size N, and 
an integer K  as input parameters and returns an integer, 
minimum sum of all the elements after performing N operations.


Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:

1<=N,K<=10^4
1<=A[i]<=10^6
