You are given n-platform and two main running 
railway tracks for both directions. 

Trains that need to stop at your station must 
occupy one platform for their stoppage and the 
trains which need not stop at your station will 
run away through either of the main track 
without stopping. 

Now, each train has three values first arrival time, 
second departure time, and the third required 
platform number. 

We are given m such trains you have to tell the 
maximum number of trains for which you can 
provide stoppage at your station.

Note: Trains are given in the form of {arrival time, 
departure time, platform Number} and the arrival 
time and departure time are represented by a 4-digit 
integer as 1030 will represent 10:30 and 912 will 
represent 09:12 (24 hour Clock).


Example 1:

Input : n = 3, m = 6 

Train no.|  Arrival Time |Dept. Time | Platform No.
    1    |   10:00       |  10:30    |    1
    2    |   10:10       |  10:30    |    1
    3    |   10:00       |  10:20    |    2
    4    |   10:30       |  12:30    |    2
    5    |   12:00       |  12:30    |    3
    6    |   09:00       |  10:05    |    1

Output : Maximum Stopped Trains = 5

Explanation : If train no. 1 will left 
to go without stoppage then 2 and 6 can 
easily be accommodated on platform 1. 
And 3 and 4 on platform 2 and 5 on platform 3.


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function maxStop() 
which takes two integers n no of platforms, m 
number of trains, and array trains[] as input 
parameter and returns an integer. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(M*logM)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(M)


Constraints:

1 <= N <= 100
1 <= M <= 10^4
