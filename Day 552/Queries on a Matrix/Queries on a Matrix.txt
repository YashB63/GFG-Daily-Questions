You are given a matrix of dimension n*n. 

All the cells are initially, zero. 

You are given Q queries, which contains 
4 integers a b c d where (a,b) is the 
TOP LEFT cell and (c,d) is the Bottom 
Right cell of a submatrix. 

Now, all the cells of this 
submatrix have to be 
incremented by one. 

After all the Q queries 
have been performed. 

Your task is to find the 
final resulting Matrix.

Note : Zero-Based Indexing is 
used for cells of the matrix. 
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 6, q = 6,
Queries = {
{4,0,5,3},
{0,0,3,4},
{1,2,1,2},
{1,1,2,3},
{0,0,3,1},
{1,0,2,4}}.

Output: 
2 2 1 1 1 0
3 4 4 3 2 0 
3 4 3 3 2 0
2 2 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 0

Explanation:After incrementing all the
sub-matrices of given queries we will 
get the final output.

 
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, q = 2,
Queries = {
{0,0,3,3},
{0,0,2,2}}.

Output: 
2 2 2 1 
2 2 2 1  
2 2 2 1 
1 1 1 1 

Explanation:After incrementing all the
sub-matrices of given queries we will
get the final output.


Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
solveQueries() which takes n and Queries 
and input parameter and returns a matrix 
after performing all the queries.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n^2)
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000
0 <= a <= c < n
0 <= b <= d < n
1 <= No. of Queries <= 1000
