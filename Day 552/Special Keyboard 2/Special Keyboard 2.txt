Geek wants to print n times 'A' 
on the screen of a computer. 

You can perform one of two operations 
on this computer for each step and 
return the minimum number of 
operations to get the character 
'A' exactly n times on the screen.

Two Operations are:

Copy All: You can copy all the characters on 
the screen (a partial copy is not allowed).

Paste: You can paste the characters 
which are copied last time.


Example 1:

Input: 
n = 3

Output: 
3

Explanation:
Initially, we have one character 'A'.
In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'
As you can see, we only need three operations 
to get three times 'A' on the screen.


Example 2:

Input: 
n = 1

Output: 
0

Explanation:
Here, We don't need do any operations 
because single A is already there.


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

You only need to complete the function 
findminoperation() which takes one 
integer n as input and returns an 
integer denoting operation taken to 
print 'A', n times.


Expected Time Complexity:  O(sqrt(n))
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 < n < 10^9
