You are given a Binary Search Tree (BST) 
containing unique positive integers 
greater than 0.

Your task is to determine whether 
the BST contains a dead end.

Note: A dead end is a leaf node 
in the BST such that no new node 
can be inserted in the BST at or 
below this node while maintaining 
the BST property and the constraint 
that all node values must be > 0.


Examples:

Input: root[] = [8, 5, 9, 2, 7, N, N, 1]

Output: true

Explanation: Node 1 is a Dead End in the given BST.


Input: root[] = [8, 7, 10, 2, N, 9, 13]

Output: true

Explanation: Node 9 is a Dead End in the given BST.


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 3000
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^5
