Given an array arr, complete the following three functions:

searchEle: This function searches for an element x in the array arr. 

It should return a boolean value - true if 
the element is found, and false otherwise.

insertEle: This function inserts an element y at index yi in the array. 

true will be printed if the insertion is done correctly, 
and false otherwise.

deleteEle: This function deletes the first 
occurrence of an element z in the array. 

true will be printed if the deletion is 
done correctly, and false otherwise.

Note: 0-based indexing is followed.


Example:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 0, 2], x=1, y=2, yi=2, z=0

Ouput: true true true

Explanation: As x=1 is present in the array, so return 1. 
After inserting y=2 at yi=2th index, the array becomes 2,4,2,1,0,2. 

After deleting z=0, the array becomes 2,4,2,1,2


Input: arr[] = [17, 15, 8, 9, 12], x=10, y=6, yi=2, z=5

Ouput: false true true

Explanation: As x=10 is not present in the array, so return 0. 

After inserting y=6 at yi=2th index, the array becomes 17,15,6,8,9,12. 

As z=5 not present, the arrays stays as 17,15,6,8,9,12.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 1500
1 <= x, y, z<= 10^3
0 <= yi< arr.size()
0 <= arri <= 10^5
