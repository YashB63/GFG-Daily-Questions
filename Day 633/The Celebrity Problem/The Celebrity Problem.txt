A celebrity is a person who is known to 
all but does not know anyone at a party. 

A party is being organized by some people. 

A square matrix mat[][] of size n*n is used 
to represent people at the party such that 
if an element of row i and column j is set 
to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. 

You need to return the index of 
the celebrity in the party, if 
the celebrity does not exist, 
return -1.

Note: Follow 0-based indexing.


Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1, 0],
                [0, 1, 0],
                [0, 1, 1]]

Output: 1

Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both know 1st 
person and 1st person does not know anyone. 

Therefore, 1 is the celebrity person.


Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1], 
                [1, 1]]

Output: -1

Explanation: Since both the people 
at the party know each other. 

Hence none of them is a celebrity person.


Input: mat[][] = [[1]]

Output: 0


Constraints:

1 ≤ mat.size() ≤ 1000
0 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 1
mat[i][i] = 1
