Given two integers n and m (m != 0). 

The problem is to find the number 
closest to n and divisible by m. 

If there is more than one such number, 
then output the one having the maximum 
absolute value.


Examples :

Input: n = 13, m = 4

Output: 12

Explanation: 12 is the Closest Number 
to 13 which is divisible by 4.


Input: n = -15, m = 6

Output: -18

Explanation: Both -12 and -18 are closest to -15 
and divisible by 6, but -18 has the maximum 
absolute value. 

So, output is -18.


Constraints:
-10^5 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5
