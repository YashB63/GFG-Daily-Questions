Given an unsorted array arr. 

Find the count of elements 
less than or equal to the 
given element x.


Examples:

Input: x = 9, arr = [10, 1, 2, 8, 4, 5] 

Output: 5

Explanation: The 5 elements are 1, 2, 8, 4 and 5.


Input: x = 2, arr = [1, 2, 2, 5, 7, 2, 9] 

Output: 4 

Explanation: The 4 elements are 1, 2, 2 and 2.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5
1 <= ai <= 10^5
0 <= x <= 10^5
