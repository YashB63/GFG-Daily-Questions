Given two strings S1 and S2 print whether they 
contain any common subsequence (non empty) or not.

NOTE: Print 1 if they have a 
common subsequence (non empty) else 0.


Example 1:

Input: S1 = "ABEF" , S2 = "CADE"
Output: 1
Explanation: "A", "E", "AE" are in 
both S1 and S2.


Example 2:

Input: S1 = "ABCDE" , S2 = "FGHIJ"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no common
subsequences .

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. 
Complete the function commonSubseq() which takes 
S1 and S2 as input parameter and returns 1 
if they have a common subsequence (non empty) else 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(K), Where K = Constant.

Constraints:
1<= |S1|=|S2| <=1000
