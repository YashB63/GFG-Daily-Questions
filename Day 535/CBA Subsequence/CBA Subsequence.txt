Given a string, rearrange it in such a 
way that it has no subsequence as cba. 

If there are multiple answers return 
the lexicographically smallest one.


Example 1:

Input:
N=6
S="aaaaab"

Output:
aaaaab

Explanation: "aaaaab" has no subsequence as cba and is 
lexicographically the smallest one.


Example 2:

Input: 
N=3 
S="cba"

Output: 
abc.

Explanation: "abc" has no subsequence as cba and is
lexicographically the smallest one.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
cbaSubsequence() which takes the string 
S, its size N as input parameters and 
returns the rearranged string.


Expected Time Complexity: O(NLogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
 

Constraints:

1<=N<=10^5
S contains only lowercase 
English alphabets.
