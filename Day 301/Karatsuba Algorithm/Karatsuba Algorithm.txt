Given two binary strings A and B that 
represent value of two integers, 
find the product of two strings in 
Decimal Value.

 
Example 1:

Input:
A = "1100" , B = "01"

Output:
12

Explanation:
Decimal representation of A is 12 and
that of B is 1. So, A*B gives the
output 12.


Example 2:

Input:
A = "01" , B = "01"

Output:
1

Explanation:
Decimal representation of both A and 
B is 1. So, A*B gives the output 1.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything.

Your task is to complete the function karatsubaAlgo() 
which takes Strings A and B as input and returns the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(Length of Binary String)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= |A|,|B| <= 25
