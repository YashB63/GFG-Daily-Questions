Given two strings check whether first string 
could be converted to the second string but the conditions are:

1.If the character is at odd place you can swap 
this character with the characters only 
at the odd places in the given first string.

2.If the character is at even place you can swap 
this character with the characters only at the even places      
in the given first string.

3.You cannot insert or delete any character on your own.


Example 1:

Input: geeks for

Output: 0

Explanation: Two strings are of
different length. They can't be equal.


Example 2:

Input: skeeg geeks

Output: 1

Explanation:

In first string characters at odd indices are 
's', 'e', 'g'
In second string characters at odd indices are 
'g', 'e', 's'
After swaping index 1st and 3rd of first
string all the characters at odd positions 
become equal.
Same for even indices.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function EqualString() 
which takes first string as first parameter and 
second string as second parameter and returns 1 
if first string can be made equal to the 
second string otherwise returns 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

Expected Space Complexity: O(K) where K is constant.


Constraints:

1 <= length of both strings <= 1000
