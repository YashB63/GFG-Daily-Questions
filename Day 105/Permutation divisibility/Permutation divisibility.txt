You are given a number. 
Your task is to check if there exists a permutation 
of the digits of this number which is divisible by 4.  


Example 1:

Input: 003 

Output: 1

Explanation: For 003, we have a permutation
300  which is  divisible by 4.


Example 2:

Input:
123456

Output:
1

Explanation:
For 123456, we have 123564 which is a
permutation of 123456 and is divisible by 4.
 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function divisible_by_four() 
which takes string as input parameter and returns 1 
if any permutaion of string is divisible by 4 
otherwise returns 0.
