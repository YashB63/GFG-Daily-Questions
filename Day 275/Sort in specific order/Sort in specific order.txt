Given an array arr[] of positive integers. 

Your task is to sort them so that the first part 
of the array contains odd numbers sorted in descending order, 
and the rest of the portion contains even numbers sorted 
in ascending order.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 10]

Output: [7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 10]

Explanation: 7 5 3 1 are odds in descending order 
and 2 4 10 are evens in ascending order.


Input: arr[] = [0, 4, 5, 3, 7, 2, 1]

Output: [7, 5, 3, 1, 0, 2, 4]

Explanation: 7 5 3 1 are odds in descending order 
and 0 2 4 are evens in ascending order.


Expected Time Complexity:  O(nlog(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space:  O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
0 <= arri <= 10^18
