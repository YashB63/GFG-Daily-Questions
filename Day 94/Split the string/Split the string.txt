Given a string S, you have to check if 
we can split it into four strings such that 
each string is non-empty and distinct from each other.
 

Example 1:

Input :
S = "geeksforgeeks"

Output:
1

Explanation:
"geeks", "for", "gee", "ks" are four
distinct strings that can form from
given string.


Example 2:

Input: 
S = "aaabb" 

Output:
0

Explanation:
It's not possible to split string S in four
distinct strings

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function isPossible() 
which takes the string S as input parameter and 
returns 1 if it's possible to split S into 
four strings such that each string is non-empty 
and distinct from each other or return 0 otherwise. 
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|^3)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)


Constraints:
1< |S| <=10000
