Given a Binary String S (the string that contains only 0's and 1's). 

Find the minimum number of palindromic subsequences 
that are needed to be removed such that string S becomes empty.


Example 1:

Input: N = 5, S = "10001"

Output: 1

Explanation: We can remove whole S, as
S is already a palindrome.


Example 2: 

Input: N = 8, S = "10001001"

Output: 2

Explanation: First we'll remove sub-
sequence "111" and then "00000".

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function MinRemove() 
which takes the length of string and the 
string as inputs and returns the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^8
