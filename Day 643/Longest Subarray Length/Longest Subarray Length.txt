You are given an array of integers arr[]. 

Your task is to find the length of the 
longest subarray such that all the 
elements of the subarray are smaller 
than or equal to the length of the 
subarray.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]

Output: 3

Explanation: The longest subarray is the 
entire array itself, which has a length 
of 3. 

All elements in the subarray are less 
than or equal to 3.


Input: arr[] = [6, 4, 2, 5]

Output: 0

Explanation: There is no subarray where 
all elements are less than or equal to 
the length of the subarray. 

The longest subarray is empty, which 
has a length of 0.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
