You are given a number n. 

The number n can be negative or positive. 

If n is negative, print numbers from n to 
0 by adding 1 to n in the neg function. 

If positive, print numbers from n-1 to 0 by 
subtracting 1 from n in the pos function.

Note:- You don't have to return anything, 
you just have to print the array.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 0

Output:
already Zero


Example 2:

Input:
n = 4

Output:
3 2 1 0


Example 3:

Input:
n = -3

Output:
-3 -2 -1 0


Your Task:

This is a function problem. 

You don't need to take input of test cases. 

Just complete the functions pos() and neg().
