You are given an array of strings arr[] that represents 
a valid arithmetic expression written in Reverse Polish 
Notation (Postfix Notation). 

Your task is to evaluate the expression and return 
an integer representing its value.

Note: A postfix expression is of the form operand1 
operand2 operator (e.g., "a b +"). 

And the division operation between two integers 
always computes the floor value, i.e floor(5 / 3) 
= 1 and floor(-5 / 3) = -2.

It is guaranteed that the result of the expression 
and all intermediate calculations will fit in a 
32-bit signed integer.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = ["2", "3", "1", "*", "+", "9", "-"]

Output: -4

Explanation: If the expression is converted into 
an infix expression, it will be 2 + (3 * 1) – 9 
= 5 – 9 = -4.


Input: arr[] = ["2", "3", "^", "1", "+"]

Output: 9

Explanation: If the expression is converted into 
an infix expression, it will be 2 ^ 3 + 1 = 8 + 1 
= 9.


Constraints:

3 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^3

arr[i] is either an operator: 
"+", "-", "*", "/" or "^", or 
an integer in the range 
[-10^4, 10^4]
