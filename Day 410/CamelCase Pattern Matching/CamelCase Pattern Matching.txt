Given a dictionary of words arr[] where each word 
follows CamelCase notation, print all words in the 
dictionary that match with a given pattern pat 
consisting of uppercase characters only.

CamelCase is the practice of writing compound words 
or phrases such that each word or abbreviation begins 
with a capital letter. 

Common examples include PowerPoint and Wikipedia, 
GeeksForGeeks, CodeBlocks, etc.

Example: "GeeksForGeeks" matches the pattern "GFG", 
because if we combine all the capital letters in 
"GeeksForGeeks" they become "GFG". 

Also note "GeeksForGeeks" matches with the pattern 
"GFG" and also "GF", but does not match with "FG".

Note: The driver code will sort your answer before 
checking and return the answer in any order.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = ["WelcomeGeek", "WelcomeToGeeksForGeeks", "GeeksForGeeks"], pat = "WTG"

Output: ["WelcomeToGeeksForGeeks"]

Explanation: Since only "WelcomeToGeeksForGeeks" 
matches the pattern, it is the only answer.


Input: arr[] = ["Hi", "Hello", "HelloWorld", "HiTech", "HiGeek", 
"HiTechWorld", "HiTechCity", "HiTechLab"], pat = "HA"

Output: []

Explanation: None of the words matches the given pattern.


Constraints:
1<= arr.size() <=1000
1<= pat.size() <=100
1<= arr[i].size() <=100
