Given an array arr. 

Determine if there exists an element in the array 
such that the sum of the elements on its left is 
equal to the sum of the elements on its right. 

If there are no elements to the left/right, 
then the sum is considered to be zero. 


Example:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 3]

Output: true

Explanation: Consider 1-based indexing i = 3, 
for [1, 2] sum is 3 and for [3] sum is also 3.


Input: arr[] = [1, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: No such index present.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5 
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
