You are given a number x and array arr[]. 

Your task is to rearrange the elements of 
the array according to the absolute 
difference with x, i.e., an element having 
minimum difference comes first, and so on.

Note: If two or more elements are at equal 
distances arrange them in the same sequence 
as in the given array.


Examples:

Input: x = 7, arr[] = [10, 5, 3, 9, 2]

Output: [5, 9, 10, 3, 2]

Explanation: Sorting the numbers according to 
the absolute difference with 7, we have array 
elements as 5, 9, 10, 3, 2.


Input: x = 6, arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Explanation: Sorting the numbers according to 
the absolute difference with 6, we have array 
elements as 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.


Constraints:

1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
