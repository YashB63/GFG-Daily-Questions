Given a singly linked list. 

The task is to remove duplicates 
(nodes with duplicate values) 
from the given list (if it exists).

Note: Try not to use extra space. 

The nodes are arranged in a sorted way.


Examples:

Input:
LinkedList: 2->2->4->5

Output: 2 -> 4 -> 5

Explanation: In the given linked list 
2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5, only 2 occurs more 
than 1 time. 

So we need to remove it once.


Input:
LinkedList: 2->2->2->2->2

Output: 2

Explanation: In the given linked list  
2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2, 2 is the only element 
and is repeated 5 times. 

So we need to remove any four 2.


Expected Time Complexity : O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes, data of nodes <= 10^5
