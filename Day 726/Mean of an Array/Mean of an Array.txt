Given an unsorted array arr[], the task 
is to find the mean of the array. 

Note: Return the floor value of the mean.


Examples:


Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 4, 2, 6, 5, 8, 7]

Output: 4

Explanation: Sum of the elements is 1 + 3 + 4 + 
2 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 7 = 36, Mean = 36/8 = 4

Input: arr[] = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Output: 4

Explanation: Sum of the elements is 
4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20, Mean = 20/5 = 4


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^6
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
