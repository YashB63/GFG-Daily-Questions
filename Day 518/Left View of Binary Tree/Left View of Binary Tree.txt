You are given the root of a binary tree. 

Your task is to return the left view of 
the binary tree. 

The left view of a binary tree is the set 
of nodes visible when the tree is viewed 
from the left side.

If the tree is empty, return an empty list.


Examples :

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, N, N]

Output: [1, 2, 4]

Explanation: From the left side of the tree,
only the nodes 1, 2, and 4 are visible.


Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, N, N, 4, N, N, 5, N, N]

Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]

Explanation: From the left side of the tree, 
the nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 are visible.


Input: root[] = [N]

Output: []


Constraints:

0 <= number of nodes <= 10^6
0 <= node -> data <= 10^5
