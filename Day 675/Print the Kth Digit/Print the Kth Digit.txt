Given two numbers a and b, find 
k^th digit from right of a^b.


Example 1:

Input: a = 3, b = 3, k = 1

Output: 7

Explanation: 3^3 = 27 and 1st digit from right is 7


Input: a = 5, b = 2, k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: 5^2 = 25 and second digit from right is 2.


Constraints:

1 <= a,b <= 15
1 <= k <= digits in a^b
