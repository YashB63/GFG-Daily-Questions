Given an n-digit large number in form of string, 
check whether it is divisible by 7 or not. 
Print 1 if divisible by 7, otherwise 0.


Example 1:

Input: num = "8955795758"
Output: 1
Explanation: 8955795758 is divisible
by 7.


Example 2:

Input: num = "1000"
Output: 0
Explanation: 1000 is not divisible
by 7.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function isdivisible7â€‹() 
which takes the string num as inputs and returns the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|num|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ |num| ≤ 10^5
