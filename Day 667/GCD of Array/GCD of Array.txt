Given an array of n positive integers, 
find the GCD of all the array elements.


Example :

Input: n = 3, arr = [1, 2, 3]

Output: 1

Explanation: GCD of 1,2,3 is 1.


Input: n = 4, arr = [2, 4, 6, 8]

Output: 2

Explanation: Greatest common divisor 
of all the numbers is 2.


Constraints:
1 ≤ N, arr[i] ≤ 10^5
