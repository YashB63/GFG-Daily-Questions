Given a sorted integer array arr[] and an integer k, 
determine if it is possible to split the array into 
one or more consecutive subsequences such that:

Each subsequence consists of consecutive integers 
(each number is exactly one greater than the previous).

Every subsequence has a length of at least k.

Return true if such a split is possible, 
otherwise return false.


Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5], k = 2

Output: true

Explanation: arr can be split into three 
subsequence of length k - [2, 3], [2, 3], 
[4, 5].


Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], k = 4

Output: false

Explanation: It is impossible to split arr 
into consecutive increasing subsequences 
of length 4 or more.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size()  ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
1 ≤  k ≤  arr.size()
