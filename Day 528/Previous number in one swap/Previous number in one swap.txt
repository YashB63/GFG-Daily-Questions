Given a non-negative number 
N in the form of string. 

The task is to apply at most one 
swap operation on the number N so 
that the result is just a previous 
possible number.

Note:  Leading zeros are not allowed.

 
Example 1:

Input :
S = "12435"

Output: 
12345

Explanation:
Although the number 12354 
will be the largest smaller 
number from 12435. But it is 
not possible to make it using 
only one swap. So swap 
4 and 3 and get 12345.
 

Example 2:

Input: 
S = " 12345"

Output: 
-1

Explanation:
Digits are in increasing order. 
So it is not possible to 
make a smaller number from it.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function 
previousNumber() which takes the string 
S and returns the previous number of S. 

If no such number exists return -1;

 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
2<=|Number length |<=10^5
