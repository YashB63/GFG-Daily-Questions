Charul has been assigned a challenge by Ishaan. 

He needs to fill a container with exactly k liters 
of water using some vessels, each with a different capacity. 

The capacities of the vessels are given in an array arr[]. 

The goal is to fill the container without any overflow, 
and no vessel can be filled partially.

Determine if Charul can fill the container up 
to exactly k liters using the given vessels. 

You can assume there is an unlimited supply of water, 
but each vessel's capacity must be used fully.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [6, 3, 4, 2, 1], k = 20

Output: true

Explanation: Use the 6-liter vessel 3 times to get 18 liters. 

Use the 2-liter vessel once to get a total of 20 liters.


Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 3], k = 15

Output: true

Explanation: The container can be filled exactly up to 
15 liters using a combination of the given vessels.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n*k)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(k)


Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1000
1 ≤ k ≤ 1000
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
