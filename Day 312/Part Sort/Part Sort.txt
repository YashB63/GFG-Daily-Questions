Given an array arr of size N and two integers l and r, 
the task is to sort the given array in non - decreasing 
order in the index range from l to r.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 2}
l = 2, r = 3

Output: {1, 5, 2, 3}

Explanation: After sorting array
will look like {1, 5, 2, 3} 


Example 2:

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {2, 3, 4}
l = 0, r = 2

Output: {2, 3, 4}

Explanation: Array is already sorted


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function partSort() 
which takes the array arr[], N, l and r as inputs 
and sorts the given the array in given range.


Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ l, r ≤ N-1
