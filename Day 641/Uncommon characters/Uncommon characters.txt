You are given two strings s1 and s2. 

Your task is to identify the characters 
that appear in either string but not in 
both (i.e., characters that are unique 
to one of the strings). 

Return the result as a sorted string.


Examples:

Input: s1 = "geeksforgeeks", s2 = "geeksquiz"

Output: "fioqruz"

Explanation: The characters 'f', 'i', 'o', 'q', 
'r', 'u', and 'z' are present in either s1 or 
s2, but not in both.


Input: s1 = "characters", s2 = "alphabets"

Output: "bclpr"

Explanation: The characters 'b', 'c', 'l', 'p', 
and 'r' are present in either s1 or s2, but not 
in both.


Input: s1 = "rome", s2 = "more"

Output: ""

Explanation: Both strings contain the same 
characters, so there are no unique characters. 

The output is an empty string.


Constraints:

1<= s1.size(), s2.size() <= 10^5

Both strings contain only 
lowercase English letters.
