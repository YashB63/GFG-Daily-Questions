Given two arrays of integers a[] and b[] 
of size n and m, the task is to check if 
a pair of values (one value from each array) 
exists such that swapping the elements of the 
pair will make the sum of two arrays equal.

Note: Return 1 if there exists any such pair otherwise return -1.


Example 1:

Input: n = 6, m = 4, a[] = {4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2}, b[] = (3, 6, 3, 3)

Output: 1

Explanation: Sum of elements in a[] = 11, 
Sum of elements in b[] = 15, To get same sum 
from both arrays, we can swap following values: 
1 from a[] and 3 from b[]


Example 2:

Input: n = 4, m = 4, a[] = {5, 7, 4, 6}, b[] = {1, 2, 3, 8}

Output: 1

Explanation: We can swap 6 from array a[] and 2 from array b[]
Expected Time Complexity: O(mlogm+nlogn).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6
0 <= a[i], b[i] <= 10^5
