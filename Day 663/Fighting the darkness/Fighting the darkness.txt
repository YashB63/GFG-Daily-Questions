Given an array arr[] representing the size of 
candles which is reduced by 1 unit each day. 

The room is illuminated using all the present candles. 

Find the maximum number of days the room will stay 
illuminated (at least one candle having a size 
greater than 0)


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2] 

Output: 2

Explanation: The candle's length 
is reduced by 1 in first day. 

So, at the end of day 1: Sizes would 
be [0 0 1], So, at end of second day: 
Sizes would be [0 0 0]. 

This means the room was illuminated for 2 days.


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 2, 1] 

Output: 4


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
