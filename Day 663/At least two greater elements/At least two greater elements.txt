Given an array arr of distinct elements, 
the task is to return an array of all 
elements except the two greatest 
elements in sorted order.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 8, 7, 1, 5]

Output: [1, 2, 5] 

Explanation: Here we return an array contains 
1 , 2, 5 and we leave two greatest elements 
7 & 8. 


Input: arr[] = [7, -2, 3, 4, 9, -1]

Output: [-2, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation: Here we return an array contains 
-2 , -1, 3, 4 and we leave two greatest 
elements 7 & 9. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(nlog(n))
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)


Constraints:

3 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10^5
-10^6 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
