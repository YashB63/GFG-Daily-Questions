A Lucas Number is a number which is represented 
by the following recurrence

Ln = Ln-1 + Ln-2 for n>1
L0 = 2
L1 = 1

Given a number N, find the Nth lucas number.

Note: Since the output may be very large 
calculate the answer modulus 10^9+7.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 5

Output: 11

Explanation: L3 + L4 = L5
L3 = 4 and L4 = 7


Example 2:

Input: 
N = 7

Output: 29

Explanation: L5 + L6 = L7
L5 = 11 and L6 = 18

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function lucas() 
which takes integer N  as input parameter and 
return Nth  Lucas number.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
