Given an array of arr[] and Q queries of indices. 

For each query indices[i], determine the count of 
elements in arr that are strictly greater than 
arr[indices[i]] to its right 
(after the position indices[i]).


Examples :

Input: arr[] = [3, 4, 2, 7, 5, 8, 10, 6], queries = 2, indices[] = [0, 5]

Output:  [6, 1]

Explanation: The next greater elements to the right of 3(index 0) 
are 4,7,5,8,10,6. 

The next greater elements to the right of 8(index 5) is only 10.


Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1], queries = 2, indices[] = [0, 3]

Output:  [3, 0]

Explanation: The count of numbers to the right of index 0 
which are greater than arr[0] is 3 i.e. (2, 3, 4). 

Similarly, the count of numbers to the right of index 3 which 
are greater than arr[3] is 0, since there are no greater 
elements than 4 to the right of the array.


Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ queries ≤ 100
0 ≤ indices[i] ≤ N - 1
