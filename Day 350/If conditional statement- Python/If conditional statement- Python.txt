You are familiar with basics of input/output 
and many other useful things in Python. 

This module is all about conditional statements 
like if, elif, else; for, while, etc.

In Python, any conditional statement ends with ':' 
(proper indentation must be followed while working 
through loops).

There are two friends, John and Smith, 
and the parameters j_angry and s_angry 
to indicate if each is angry. 

You are in trouble if both of them are 
angry or no one of them is angry.

Now, complete the function which returns true 
if you are in trouble, else return false


Example 1:

Input:
j_angry = True, s_angry = True

Output:
True

Explanation:
Since both of them are angry,
so you are in trouble.


Example 2:

Input:
j_angry = True, s_angry = False

Output:
False

Explanation:
Only one of them is angry, 
so we are not in trouble.


Your Task:

This is a function problem, you 
don't need to take any input. 

Complete the function friends_in_trouble() 
and return True or False.
