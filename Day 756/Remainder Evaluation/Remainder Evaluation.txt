Given two positive integers n1 and n2, the task is
to find the remainder when n1 is divided by n2.


Examples:

Input: n1 = 5, n2 = 3

Output: 2

Explanation: The remainder after dividing 5 by 3 is: 2.


Input: n1 = 5, n2 = 10

Output: 5

Explanation: 5 cannot be divided by 10 so it is the Remainder.


Constraints:

0 <= n1 <= 10^6
1 <= n2 <= 10^6
