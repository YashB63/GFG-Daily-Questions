Given an array arr[] of integers and a hash table of size m, 
insert each element of the array into the hash table using 
Quadratic Probing for collision handling.

Note: All the positions that are unoccupied 
are denoted by -1 in the hash table.

Quadratic Probing is a collision handling technique used in hashing. 

When a collision occurs (i.e. two elements hash to the same index), 
Quadratic Probing searches for the next available slot using a 
quadratic function of the form: newIndex = (originalIndex + i2) % m 
(i = number of collisions seen so far for this insertion)


Examples :

Input: arr[] = [21, 10, 33, 43], m = 5

Output: [10, 21, -1, 33, 43]

Explanation:
21 % 5 = 1, So 21 goes into hashtable[1],
10 % 5 = 0, So 10 goes into hashtable[0],
33 % 5 = 3, So 33 goes into hashtable[3],
43 % 5 = 3, but hashtable[3] is already filled so we try 
(3 + 12) % 5 = 4, So 43 goes into hashtable[4] because it 
is empty.


Input: arr[] = [31, 48, 37, 70], m = 4

Output: [48, 37, 70, 31]

Explanation:
31 % 4 = 3, So 31 goes into hashtable[3],
48 % 4 = 0, So 48 goes into hashtable[0],
37 % 4 = 1, So 37 goes into hashtable[1],
70 % 4 = 2, So 70 goes into hashtable[2].


Constraints:

2 ≤ m ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ m
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
