You are given two integer variables x and y. 

You need to perform the following operations:

p = x + y : Addition
q = x - y : Subtraction
r = x * y :Multiplication
s = x / y : Division
t = x % y : Modulo


Examples:

Input: x = 1, y = 2

Output: 3 -1 2 0 1 

Explanation: The given operations are performed.
