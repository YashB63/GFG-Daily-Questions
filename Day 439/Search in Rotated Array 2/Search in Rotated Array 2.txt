Given a sorted and rotated array arr 
and a target key k which is rotated 
at some point, and may contain 
duplicates and given an element key. 

Check whether the key is 
present in the array or not.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2], k = 0

Output: true

Explanation: 0 is found at index 3.


Input: arr[] = [2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2], k = 3

Output: false

Explanation: There is no element that has value 3.


Expected Time Complexity: O(logn)
Expected Auxilary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^8
1 ≤ key ≤ 10^8
