Given a string s of size n and q queries.

Each query is either of the following types:

Type 1- Rotate the string by K character from the end.

Type 2- Print the character at the I'th index 
of the resulting string at that instant.

Answer all queries.


Example 1:

Input:
n=7 q=5
s=abcdefg
Query1: Type=1 K=2
Query2: Type=2 I=0
Query3: Type=2 I=6
Query4: Type=1 K=4
Query5: Type=2 I=1

Output:
f
e
c

Explanation:
After First query String becomes-"fgabcde"
Second query returns - 'f'
Third query returns -'e'
After Fourth Query String becomes-"bcdefga"
Fifth Query returns -'c'


Example 2:

Input:
n=5 q=2
s=geeks
Query1: Type=1 K=4
Query2: Type=2 I=4

Output:
g

Explanation:
After first query,string becomes "eeksg".
Second query returns 'g'.


Your task:

You don't need to read input or print anything.

Your task is to complete the function StringQuery() 
which takes an integer N,an integer Q, a string S 
and two arrays Q1 and Q2(containing Query type and 
K/I respectively) and returns an array containing 
the answers to the queries.


Expected Time Complexity:O(q)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)


Constraints:

1<=n<=10^5
1<=q<=10^4
1<=Type<=2
1<=K<=10^9
0<=I<N
