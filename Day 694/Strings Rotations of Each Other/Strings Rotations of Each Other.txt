You are given two strings s1 and s2, of equal lengths. 

The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the 
string s1.

Note: A string is a rotation of another if it can be 
formed by moving characters from the start to the end 
(or vice versa) without rearranging them.


Examples :

Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"

Output: true

Explanation: After 2 right rotations, s1 will become equal to s2.


Input: s1 = "aab", s2 = "aba"

Output: true

Explanation: After 1 left rotation, s1 will become equal to s2.


Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "acbd"

Output: false

Explanation: Strings are not rotations of each other.


Constraints:

1 ≤ s1.size(), s2.size() ≤ 10^5
s1, s2 consists of lowercase English alphabets.
