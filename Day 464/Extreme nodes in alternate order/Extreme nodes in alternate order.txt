You are given a binary tree. 

You have to return alternating 
extremes of each level starting 
from the right extreme. 

It means you have to return the 
rightmost node of 1st level then 
the leftmost of the second level 
then the rightmost and so on.


Examples:

Input:
       1
     /  \
   2    3

Output: 1 2

Explanation: In level one [1] rightmost 
is 1 and in level 2 [2, 3] lefmost is 2. 


Input:
      2
     /  \
   1    3
       /
     4

Output: [2, 1, 4]

Explanation: In level one [2] rightmost is 2, 
In level 2 [1, 3] lefmost is 1 and in level 3 
[4] rightmost is 4. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 5*10^5
