Given a linked list and a value x, 
partition it such that all nodes 
less than x come first, then all 
nodes with a value equal to x, 
and finally nodes with a value 
greater than x. 

The original relative order of the nodes 
in each of the three partitions should be 
preserved.
 
The partition must work in place.
 

Examples:

Input: Linked list: 1->4->3->2->5->2->3, x = 3

Output: 1->2->2->3->3->4->5

Explanation: Nodes with a value less than 3 come 
first, then equal to 3 and then greater than 3.


Input: Linked list: 1->4->2->10, x = 3

Output: 1->2->4->10

Explanation: Nodes with value less than 3 come 
first, then equal to 3 and then greater than 3.


Expected Time Complexity : O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)
 

Constraints:

1 <= size of linked list <= 10^5
1 <= data of node <= 10^5
1 <= x <= 10^5
