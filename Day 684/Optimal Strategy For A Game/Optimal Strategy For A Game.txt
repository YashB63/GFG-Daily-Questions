You are given an integer array arr[] of size n(even). 

The array elements represent n coins of values 
v1, v2, ....vn.

You play against an opponent in an alternating way. 

In each turn, a player selects either the first or 
last coin from the row, removes it from the row 
permanently, and receives the coin's value.

You need to determine the maximum possible 
amount of money you can win if you go first.

Note: Both the players are playing optimally.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 7, 10]

Output: 15

Explanation: The user collects the 
maximum value as 15(10 + 5). 

It is guaranteed that we cannot get 
more than 15 by any possible moves.


Input: arr[] = [8, 15, 3, 7]

Output: 22

Explanation: The user collects the maximum value as 22(7 + 15). 

It is guaranteed that we cannot get more than 22 by 
any possible moves.


Constraints:

2 <= n <= 10^3
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
