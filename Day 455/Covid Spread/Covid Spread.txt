Aterp is the head nurse at a city hospital. 

City hospital contains R*C number of wards 
and the structure of a hospital is in the 
form of a 2-D matrix.

Given a matrix of dimension R*C where 
each cell in the matrix can have values 
0, 1, or 2 which has the following meaning:

0: Empty ward
1: Cells have uninfected patients
2: Cells have infected patients

An infected patient at ward [i,j] can 
infect other uninfected patient at 
indexes [i-1,j], [i+1,j], [i,j-1], 
[i,j+1] (up, down, left and right) 
in unit time. 

Help Aterp determine the minimum units 
of time after which there won't remain 
any uninfected patient i.e all patients 
would be infected. 

If all patients are not infected after 
infinite units of time then simply 
return -1.


Example 1:

Input:
3 5
2 1 0 2 1
1 0 1 2 1
1 0 0 2 1 

Output:
2

Explanation:
Patients at positions {0,0}, {0, 3}, {1, 3}
and {2, 3} will infect patient at {0, 1}, 
{1, 0},{0, 4}, {1, 2}, {1, 4}, {2, 4} during 1st 
unit time. And, during 2nd unit time, patient at 
{1, 0} will get infected and will infect patient 
at {2, 0}. Hence, total 2 unit of time is
required to infect all patients.


Example 2:

Input:
3 5
2 1 0 2 1
0 0 1 2 1
1 0 0 2 1

Output:
-1

Explanation:
All patients will not be infected.
 

Your Task: 
 
You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function helpaterp() 
which takes a 2-D Matrix hospital as input parameter 
and returns the minimum units of time in which all 
patients will be infected or -1 if it is impossible.


Constraints:

1 ≤ R,C ≤ 1000
0 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 2
