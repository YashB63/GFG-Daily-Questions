Given an array arr[] you have to find the 
maximum value of abs(i â€“ j) *min(arr[i], arr[j]) 
where i and j vary from 0 to n-1 and i != j. 


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 2, 1, 4]

Output: 9

Explanation: Here, a[0] = 3 and a[3] = 4 and 
thus result is abs(0-3)*min(3,4) = 9.


Input: arr[] = [8, 1, 9, 4]

Output: 16

Explanation: Here, a[0] = 8 and a[2] = 9 and 
thus result is abs(0-2)*min(8,9)=16. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
 

Constraints:
2 <= arr.size() <=10^6
-10^5 <= arr[i] <=10^5
