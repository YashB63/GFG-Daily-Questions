A special binary tree with 
random pointers along with 
the usual left and right 
pointers is given. 

Clone the given tree.

Note: The output is 1 if the 
tree is cloned successfully. 

Otherwise, the output is 0.


Examples:

Input:
clone-a-binary-tree-with-random-pointers

Output: 1

Explanation: The tree was cloned successfully.


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^5
