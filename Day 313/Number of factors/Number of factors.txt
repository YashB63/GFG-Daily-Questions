Find the number of factors for a given integer N.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5

Output:
2

Explanation:
5 has 2 factors 1 and 5


Example 2:

Input:
N = 25

Output:
3

Explanation:
25 has 3 factors 1, 5, 25


Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function countFactors() 
which takes an integer N as input parameters and 
returns an integer, total number factor of N.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(N))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100000
