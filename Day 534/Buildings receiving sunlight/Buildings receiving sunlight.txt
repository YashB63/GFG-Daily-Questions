Given the array arr[] of heights of certain 
buildings that lie adjacent to each other, 
Sunlight starts falling from the left side 
of the buildings. 

If there is a building of a certain height, 
all the buildings to the right side of it 
having lesser heights cannot see the sun.
 
The task is to find the total number 
of buildings that receive sunlight.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [6, 2, 8, 4, 11, 13]

Output: 4

Explanation: Only buildings of height 6, 8, 
11 and 13 can see the sun, hence output is 4.


Input: arr[] = [2, 5, 1, 8, 3]

Output: 3

Explanation: Only buildings of height 2, 5 
and 8 can see the sun, hence output is 3.


Input: arr[] = [3, 4, 1, 0, 6, 2, 3]

Output: 3


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arri ≤ 10^5
