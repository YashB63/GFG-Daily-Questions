Tom is a string freak. 

He has got sequences of words arr[] to manipulate. 

If in a sequence, two same words come 
together then Tom destroys each other. 

Find the number of words left in the 
sequence after this pairwise destruction. 


Examples:

Input: arr[] = ["ab", "aa", "aa", "bcd", "ab"]

Output: 3

Explanation: After the first iteration, 
we'll have: ab bcd ab. 

We can't further destroy more strings 
and hence we stop and the result is 3. 


Input: arr[] = ["tom", "jerry", "jerry", "tom"]

Output: 0

Explanation: After the first iteration, 
we'll have: tom tom. After the second 
iteration: 'empty-array' .Hence, the 
result is 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤10^6
1 ≤ |arri| ≤ 50
