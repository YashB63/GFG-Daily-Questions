You are given an array arr. 

Replace every element with the next greatest element 
(the greatest element on its right side) in the array. 

Note: There is no element next to the last element, 
so replace it with -1.


Example:

Input: arr[] = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]

Output: [17, 5, 5, 5, 2, -1]

Explanation: For 16 the greatest element 
on its right is 17. For 17 it's 5. 
For 4 it's 5. For 3 it's 5. For 5 it's 2. 
For 2 it's -1(no element to its right). 


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 9]

Output: [9, 9, 9, -1]

Explanation: For each element except 9 the
greatest element on its right is 9.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i]<= 10^6
