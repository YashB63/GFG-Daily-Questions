Given an array of size N, find the number 
of distinct pairs {i, j} (i != j) in the 
array such that the sum of a[i] and a[j] 
is greater than 0.


Example 1:

Input: N = 3, a[] = {3, -2, 1}

Output: 2

Explanation: {3, -2}, {3, 1} are two 
possible pairs.


Example 2:

Input: N = 4, a[] = {-1, -1, -1, 0}

Output: 0

Explanation: There are no possible pairs.


Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function ValidPair() which takes 
the array a[ ] and size of array N as input 
parameters and returns the count of such pairs.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N * Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 
-10^4  ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^4
