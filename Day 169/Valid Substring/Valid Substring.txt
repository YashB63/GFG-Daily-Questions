Given a string s consisting only of opening 
and closing parenthesis 'ie '('  and ')', 
find out the length of the longest 
valid(well-formed) parentheses substring.

NOTE: The length of the smallest valid substring ( ) is 2.


Example 1:

Input: s = "(()("

Output: 2

Explanation: The longest valid 
substring is "()". Length = 2.


Example 2:

Input: s = "()(())("

Output: 6

Explanation: The longest valid 
substring is "()(())". Length = 6.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function findMaxLen() which takes 
s as input parameter and returns the maxlength.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)   


Constraints:
1 <= |s| <= 10^5
