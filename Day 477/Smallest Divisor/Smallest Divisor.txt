You are given an array of integers arr 
and an integer k, your task is to find 
the smallest positive integer divisor, 
such that upon dividing all the elements 
of the given array by it, the sum of 
the division's result is less than or 
equal to the given integer k.

Note: Each result of the division is 
rounded to the nearest integer greater 
than or equal to that element. 

For Example: 7/3 = 3.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 5, 9], k = 6

Output: 5

Explanation: If the divisor is 5 the sum 
will be 5 (1+1+1+2), which is less than 6.


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 4, 10], k = 5

Output: 10


Input: arr[] = [7, 3, 3, 6], k = 10

Output: 3


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length() <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
nums.length() <= k <= 10^6
