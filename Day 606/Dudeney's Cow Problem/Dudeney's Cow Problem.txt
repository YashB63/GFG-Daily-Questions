Cows in FooLand are interesting animals. 

One of their specialities is related to producing offspring. 

A cow in FooLand produces its first calve (female calf) 
at the age of two years and proceeds to produce other 
calves (one female calf a year).

Now the farmer Harold wants to know how many animals 
he would have at the end of n years, if we assume 
that none of the calves dies, given that initially, 
he has only one female calf.


Examples:

Input: n = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: At the end of 1 year, he will have 
only 1 cow, at the end of 2 years he will have 
2 animals (one parent cow C1 and other baby 
calf B1 which is the offspring of cow C1).


Input: n = 4

Output: 5

Explanation: At the end of 1 year, he will have only 
1 cow, at the end of 2 years he will have 2 animals 
(one parent cow C1 and other baby calf B1 which is 
the offspring of cow C1). 

At the end of 3 years, he will have 3 animals 
(one parent cow C1 and 2 female calves B1 and 
B2, C1 is the parent of B1 and B2).

At the end of 4 years,he will have 5 animals 
(one parent cow C1, 3 offsprings of C1 i.e. 
B1, B2, B3 and one offspring of B1).
