Given the first 2 terms a1 and 
a2 of an Arithmetic Series. 

Find the nth term of the series. 


Examples:

Input: a1 = 2, a2 = 3, n = 4

Output: 5

Explanation: The series is: 2,3,4,5,6.... 
Thus, the 4th term is 5.


Input: a1 = 1, a2 = 3, n = 10

Output: 19

Explanation: The series is: 
1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21.. 

Thus, the 10th term is 19.


Constraints:

-10^4 <= a1 , a2 <= 10^4
1 <= n <= 10^4
