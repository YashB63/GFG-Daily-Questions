Given an array arr[] of integers, 
find the maximum and minimum 
possible product among all subsets 
of the array.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]

Output: [6, 1]

Explanation: Maximum product is 6 
obtained by multiplying 2 and 3. 

Minimum product is 1 obtained by 
selecting only 1.


Input: arr[] = [4, -2, 5]

Output: [20, -40]

Explanation: Maximum product is 20 obtained 
by multiplying 4 and 5. Minimum product is 
-40 obtained by multiplying 4, -2, and 5.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
-10^5 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
