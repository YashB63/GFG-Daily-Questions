Given n you have to find sum of 
count of divisors from1 to n.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2

Output: 3

Explanation: No. of Divisors of 1 = 1,
No of Divisors of 2 = 2(1, 2).


Example 2:

Input: n = 4

Output: 8

Explanation: No. of divisors of 1 = 1
No. of divisors of 2 = 2(1, 2)
No. of divisors of 3 = 2(1, 3)
No. of divisors of 4 = 3(1, 2, 4).
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything, 
Your task is to complete the function 
DivCountSum() which takes n as input 
parameter and returns the sum of count 
of divisors from 1 to n.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(nlog(n))
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)
 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
