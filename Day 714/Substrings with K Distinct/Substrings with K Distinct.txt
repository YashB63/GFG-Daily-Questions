characters and an integer k, You have to count 
all possible substrings that have exactly k 
distinct characters.


Examples :

Input: s = "abc", k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: Possible substrings are ["ab", "bc"]


Input: s = "aba", k = 2

Output: 3

Explanation: Possible substrings are ["ab", "ba", "aba"]


Input: s = "aa", k = 1

Output: 3

Explanation: Possible substrings are ["a", "a", "aa"]


Constraints:

1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ k ≤ 26
