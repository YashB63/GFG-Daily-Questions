Given a positive integer X. 
The task is to find the smallest 
even number E such that
E > X and all digits in 
X and E are the same.

Note: All the digits in X should 
be same with digits in E.

 
Example 1:

Input:
X = 34722641

Output:
34724126

Explanation:
Next greater number with same 
digits as in input is 34724126.


Example 2:

Input:
X = 111
Output:
-1
Explanation:
You can't rearrange the digits to get an answer.
 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function getNextEven() 
which takes a string X as input, 
which is representing the number and 
returns the required smallest even number. 
If no such even number exists return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N)! )
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log(N))

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9
