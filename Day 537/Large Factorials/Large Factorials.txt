Given a number n, the task is to calculate 
two values related to its factorial:

1)The first digit of the factorial of n.

2)The power of 10 that  represents the 
factorial in the form d * 10^p, where d 
is the first digit and p is the power.


Examples:

Input : n = 5

Output : [1, 2]

Explanation: Factorial of 5 = 120.

So, first digit = 1 and power 
of 10 = 2 (1 * 102).


Input : n = 9

Output : [3, 5] 

Explanation: Factorial of 9 = 362880.

So, first digit = 3 and power of 
10 = 5 (1 * 105).


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).
