You are given an array citations[], where each element citations[i] 
represents the number of citations received by the ith paper of a 
researcher. 

You have to calculate the researcher’s H-index.

The H-index is defined as the maximum value H, such that the 
researcher has published at least H papers, and all those 
papers have citation value greater than or equal to H.


Examples:

Input: citations[] = [3, 0, 5, 3, 0]

Output: 3

Explanation: There are at least 3 papers with citation counts of 
3, 5, and 3, all having citations greater than or equal to 3.


Input: citations[] = [5, 1, 2, 4, 1]

Output: 2

Explanation: There are 3 papers (with citation counts of 5, 2, and 4) 
that have 2 or more citations. 

However, the H-Index cannot be 3 because there aren't 3 papers with 3 
or more citations.


Input: citations[] = [0, 0]

Output: 0

Explanation: The H-index is 0 because there 
are no papers with at least 1 citation.


Constraints:

1 ≤ citations.size() ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ citations[i] ≤ 10^6
