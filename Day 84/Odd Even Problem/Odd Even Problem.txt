Given a string S of lowercase english characters, 
find out whether the summation of X and Y is even or odd, 
where X is the count of distinct characters which occupy 
even positions in english alphabets and 
have positive even frequency, and Y is the count of 
distinct characters which occupy odd positions 
in english alphabets and have positive odd frequency.

Note: Positive means greater than zero.


Example 1:

Input: S = "abbbcc"
Output: "ODD"
Explanation: X = 0 and Y = 1 so (X + Y) is 
ODD. 'a' occupies 1st place(odd) in english 
alphabets and its frequency is odd(1), 'b' 
occupies 2nd place(even) but its frequency 
is odd(3) so it doesn't get counted and 'c' 
occupies 3rd place(odd) but its frequency 
is even(2) so it also doesn't get counted.


Example 2:

Input: S = "nobitaa"
Output: "EVEN"
Explanation: X = 0 and Y = 2 so (X + Y) is
EVEN.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. 
Complete the function evenOdd() which takes S 
as input parameter and returns "EVEN"  
if  X + Y is even, "ODD" otherwise.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) 

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000
