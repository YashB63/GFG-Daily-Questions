Given a sentence as a string S. 

Calculate difficulty of a given sentence.

Difficulty of sentence is defined as 5*(number of hard words) + 
3*(number of easy words). 

A word in the given string is considered hard 
if it has 4 consecutive consonants or number of consonants 
are more than number of vowels. 

Else the word is easy.

Note: uppercase and lowercase characters are same.


Example 1:

Input:
S = "Difficulty of sentence"
Output:
13
Explanation:
2 hard words + 1 easy word


Example 2:

S = "I am good"
Output:
9
Explanation:
3 easy words

Your task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the functioin calcDiff() 
which takes the string S as input and 
returns the difficulty of the sentence.
 
Expected Time Complexity : O(len(s)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
1<= length( S ) <= 105
