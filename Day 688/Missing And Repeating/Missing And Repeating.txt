Given an unsorted array arr[] of size n, 
containing elements from the range 1 to n, 
it is known that one number in this range 
is missing, and another number occurs twice 
in the array,find both the duplicate number 
and the missing number.


Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 2]

Output: [2, 1]

Explanation: Repeating number is 
2 and the missing number is 1.


Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 3]
 
Output: [3, 2]

Explanation: Repeating number is 3 
and the missing number is 2.


Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 6, 2, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 5]

Explanation: Repeating number is 
1 and the missing number is 5.


Constraints:

2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
